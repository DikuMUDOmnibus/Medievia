okay, here is med src with few mods for those who requested it.
it will compile/run on FreeBSD/Linux/Solaris.
if you want to compile it on Solaris, you should change L2_FLAGS in Makefile

to check my changes, `egrep -n "(FreeBSD|linux|\(sun|MEDTHIEVIA)" *.[ch]`
in src dir. 

You can contact me at r.g.m.d


Have fun with MedThievia. :)
