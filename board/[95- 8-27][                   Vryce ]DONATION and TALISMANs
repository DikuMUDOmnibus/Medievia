DONATION and TALISMANs
Yes, donations are accepted here at Medievia!  Not only are they 
accepted, they are encouraged.  Medievia is a money sucking monster that 
takes away all of Vryce's money. Donations are the only way he has to 
supplement his contributions and ensure that Medievia stays alive. Taking 
suggestions from focus groups on how to make donations in 1995 more 
successful, we have come up with a PLAN! With donations of $$20 and up we 
will mail your character a complimentry gift! The Medievia Talisman! Its 
stats are....  AC-apply[20] HIT-Points[100] DAMROLL[7] Weight[5] Level is 0.
