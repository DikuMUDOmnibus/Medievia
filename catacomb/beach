A cavern beach~
The ground below your feet is covered with fine, black sand. The 
shiney surfaces reflect the light brilliantly, sending sparkling 
rainbows into your eyes.  Your weight pushes you a few inches into 
the surface of the beach, making walking a bit difficult.  Ahead of 
you, the seemingly black waters of a lake lap quietly at the 
shoreline.

A cavern beach~
Just a bit ahead of you lies a dark ominous lake, it's size and depth
indeterminable. You can see the sand descend in a sharp hill straight
into the water, visibility is pretty good for about thirty feet. 
After that, nothing is discernable. You may as well assume there are 
deadly creatures such as the ones in the caves you've passed through 
to get here.
