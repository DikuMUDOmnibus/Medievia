Tunnel lined with bright veins of ore~
The whole area is alive with the incredible colors lining the 
walls.  As you look around you see the raw tunnel walls lined with 
veins of ore.  The ore is like nothing you have ever seen, full of 
colors and prism effects. Could this be mana'ite?  It is said all 
the magic of the world comes from deep within the earth....and that 
mana'ite actually existed...
