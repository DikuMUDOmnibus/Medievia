A damp cold cavern~
From your light source, you can make out the jagged and
uneven edges of the cavern's walls.  They twist and turn, leading in 
many different directions.  You crouch down to avoid a low hanging 
stalactite only to see the ceiling disappear into the shadows above 
you on the other side. A light mist fills the air, covering you with 
a thin layer of moisture after a time.  Pressing your back to a wall 
and your feet against the opposite side, you carefully navigate over 
a steep pit in the cavern floor. This is indeed a dangerous place.
