A large hole ~
This is a pit about ten feet wide and completely filled
with murky water. It leads straight up and down in most places, with 
turns and dangerous corners at various intervals.  The current is 
very strong and roughly throws you against the rocky edges of this 
cavern.  Your arms flail around you in a worthless attempt to 
stabalize yourself.  Clumps of mud are knocked free from the walls, 
clouding your vision further.
