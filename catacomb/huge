A huge cavern~
You find yourself in a huge cavern room.  The walls rise up twenty or
more feet before forming a ceiling studded with spectacular 
stalactite formations.  Beneath your feet, the floor is covered with 
a sandy, gritty dirt.  The air is damp and the walls glisten with 
water, reflecting your light.  There are strange mushroom-like 
plants growing sporatically around the cavern, standing as tall as 
you are.  Swirling just above the chamber floor is a dense mist 
which the odd vegetation seems to be thriving on. Your slightest 
movements echo loudly throughout this room.
