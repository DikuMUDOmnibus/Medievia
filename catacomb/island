A mystical island~
As you walk about you begin to realize the size of this cavern and the 
wonder if this island is a natural thing or made by some ancient creatures.
Bats hover everywhere....what could the bats eat down here?  You have 
seen insects..this whole place gives you the creeps.  A large POUNDING rolls
through the island...seems as if the whole place just moved...
