An Underwater Tunnel~
Finally you come to a stop as the currents die down and deposit you 
in a small cove, carved from the water's motion. The water aroudn 
you is stained red, probably from the many cuts and bruises you've 
accumulated as you passed through the many miles of cave.

An Underwater Tunnel~
You float through an underground river, surrounded by water on all 
sides. The cavern walls form a tube around you through which the 
water flows. Most of the edges have been worn down over the ages but 
a few rocky spikes jut out into the waters path.  You push off the 
walls in an attempt to navigate the stream safely.  Patches of 
glowing yellow and red fungus grow along the river's path, seeming 
to move and crawl along the cave wall.
