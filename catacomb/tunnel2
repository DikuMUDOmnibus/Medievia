A narrow spot in the tunnel~
You feel blood drip into your eyes as you lacerate your forehead on 
some rocky protrusions. It's tough to even crawl on hands and knees 
in this part of the tunnel because of its breadth, you manage 
nontheless.

A wall with cave paintings~
Through the grain of the stone, you can see beautiful drawings of 
different aspects of this underground environment. Depictions of 
some strange ceremonies and creatures you've never even imagined 
running away from are etched into the cliff face.
