A fork in the tunnel~
As much as you'd like to go back in the direction you came
and make your way to the surface again, you're compelled to go 
further. Cries of impending doom penetrate the walls and make you 
shiver. There's a decision up ahead, you better be prepared to 
choose a direction to head in.
