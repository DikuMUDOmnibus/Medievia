This file is sorta the changes and addictions to medievia iv.
Its purpose is at first to HELP us fix the help system and then to give to
all people in mediv so they can convert from iii to iv without feeling
clueless.  It is in 2 parts   NEW and CHANGES.  All first words MUST be a
help topic that HAS been changed and or created to reflect changes and
additions.  PLEASE who ever fixes,updates or creates them, when you are
happy they are done and correct put a * in front of them. Some things are
indented.  That means the unindented theme above is a topic that quickly
says what that is and then simply lists other help topic to look at.  Please
keep this file in order.  If I forgot stuff and I am sure I did, add it. 
Keep the file format.  We need all this done in a few weeks.
