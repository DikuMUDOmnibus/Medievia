This file is used to define moving freight types.

It is a format you should be used to...

The Tags can be in any order, all in a line, all on seperate lines....any
way you like...  The file MUST end with a $ on the last line as the first
char on the line.


Now for the tags...So far we have...

NAM which is the name list to call the thing.... ends with our friend the
squigly
NAM mule beast ugly4leggedthing~

SHO is the short description, for in room and actions
SHO a covered wagon loaded with tradables~

DES is the description if ya look at it
DES The wagon is very wagon looking....it has like wheels and a lot of
stuff in it :)
~

SIZ is the SIZE total it can hold as all tradables will have a size....
This value is sorta arbitrary...  I look at it like a size of one is big
enough to hold an apple.

SIZ 850

WGT is the total weight it can hold.  All tradables have a weight...  I look
at weight as a pound.  But is is arbitrary

WGT 600

PRI is the price the thing is sold for at the trading shops...

PRI 10000
MORE to come soon like stamina, breath and endurance....how much it eats and
drinks etc...

WAGONTYPE  sets the TYPE to a wagon type of freight
MULETYPE   these types are used for the room restrictions
HORSETYPE                                                

MOB 1200
This is very important.  This says mobile 1200 is the mob we use when doing
socials and stuff for this freight type.  For instance for the covered wagon
we would use a nice big horse.  It is used like this.  SOmeone does
pet horse...  if that will work for a freight in the room tyhe code takes
that freightypes stored mob already made and pops it in the room, does the
social and pops him out.  It is VERY important that the mobile have the same
namelist as the freight.  It is also used for auto realizm code like the
horse snorting and stuff.
