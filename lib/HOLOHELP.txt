Life is SIMPLE here :)

You have 256 rooms which are 256 rooms of a variety of flavors that are used
to make landmasses.  SIMPLE!  right?  :)

Ok so the format is like this:

#NUMBER    its like 0-255 k?  IT MATCHES the color number in the paint
program we use to make the medievia world map deal thingy, which is called
medievia.raw if you must know, dont look at that, its binary :)

NOW WHAT!?  well screw the way the other world files work, I want life so
simple we cannot fuck it up so....

THE REST is just tag/value pairs, just like the new mobfile format...
And without further adue...here they are!

NAME A deep dark steamy jungle~  So ya got NAME followed by the name of
		the room ending with a, you guessed it, squigly
DSC Blah Blah
	Blah blah blah
~  Ok so here ya got the tag DSC and the description, which ends with a 
   squigly all by itself on a new line, just like the room files...

FOLLOWING are all the rest of the tags in alpha order so I know I dont
accidentally repeat any for different things.
THE CAPS YA NEED, the rest is optional so you can type DAR or DARK and it
will just say DARk..fact is you can type DARMOOMOODOGFACE! and it will do
DARK, period.

REALLY trying.
