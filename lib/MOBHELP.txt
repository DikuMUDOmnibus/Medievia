The mob file has changed dramatically.

The first few fields are the same as usual
#number
namelist~
short description~
long description
~

~

NOW things get interesting, all OTHER variables will now use
TAG / VALUE pairs...

example LEV 23     or   EXP 223372

ALL the tags listed below can be put ANYWHERE or in ANY order
as many or as few on a line as you like.  If you duplicate a variable the
last variable of the same type will be used.

BELOW we list the TAGS and what can be used with them
the tags may be UPPER OR LOWER CASE and can be whole words
for exampel you can have experience 100d25+5000  it ONLY looks at the
first 3 characters of the tag so experience will be translated to EXP

You will notice you can use DICE for many variables you could not
before.

THESE M U S T be included
----------------------------------
ACT  ACTION FLAGS 	# or #d#+#
AFF  AFFECTED FLAGS 	# or #d#+# 
ALI  ALIGNMENT		# or #d#+# 
CLA  CLASS  		W,M,C,T,O
LEV  LEVEL		# or #d#+# 
HRO  HITROLL    	# or #d#+# 
ARM  ARMOR		# or #d#+# 
HIT  HITROLL		# or #d#+# 
DAM  DAMROLL		#d#+#		NOTICE this REQUIRES a DIE 
GOL  GOLD		# or #d#+# 
EXP  EXPERIENCE		# or #d#+# 
POS  POSITION		# or #d#+# 
DPOS DEFAULT POSITION   # or #d#+# 
SEX  SEX		# or #d#+# 

NEW TAGS CODED and considered OPTIONAL
--------------------------------------
STR  STRENGTH		# or #d#+#
INT  INTELIGENCE	# or #d#+#
WIS  WISDOM		# or #d#+#
DEX  DEXTERITY		# or #d#+#
CON  CONSTITUTION	# or #d#+#
MOU  This mob is mountable
FLY  This mounted mob FLIES, also needs MOU set
MOV  MOVEMENT           # or #d#+#
!KIC  Cannot be kicked
!BAC  Cannot be Backstabbed
!TRI  Cannot be tripped
!BAS  Cannot be Bashed
!CHA  Cannot be charged
!DIS  Cannot be disarmed
!THR  Cannot be Thrown againt
!SOL  Cannot be hit by solid objects(swords, punched, kicked, hit etc)

TO BE ADDED TO CODE AT WILL and CONSIDERED   O P T I O N A L
------------------------------------------------------------
WEI  WEIGHT		# or #d#+#  in stones
HEI  HEIGHT		# or #d#+#  in centimeters


Things to be added also will be things like
!BS  cannot be backstabbed  like for a tree
!TR  cannot be tripped  like for a centipede
!BA  cannot be bashed  like for a pudding
and many many more things..including special funcs like HUNTER etc

I would SUGGEST using something of the same format we used before
like... a line would read
LEV 30 THA 0 ARM -5 HIT 10d15+2200 DAM 10d5+20
Again in no way does any variable have to be in any order etc, but it may
be easier to use the old way of which variables on which lines as to not
FORGET to include a variable REQUIRED.

This new design makes adding NEW variables to a mob file a 5 minute 
process at TOPS.  IF we wanted a VAR  !FOR  to say this mob will not
form up, 5 minute hack, it is a good thing :)
