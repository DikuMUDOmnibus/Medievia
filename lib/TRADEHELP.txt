This file DEFINES the tradables....

NAM is name  ONE WORD
DES is description
UNI is the unit name of how it is traded, like bushel, dozen, pound, barrel.
SIZ is the size, an apple is roughly 1
WGT is weight of tradable, 1 is a pound roughly.
ORX is the x origen in the holoworld.  This is so we know how much it is
worth when it is traded,  the farther away the better.
ORY is the y origen in the holoworld.  This is so we know how much it is
worth when it is traded,  the farther away the better.
VAL is the Value/Worth of one of these in gold.

Again as in all our new tag/value file types, the syntax is free flowing..
You can put the stuff in any order on any line and even repeat them if your
a slob.
