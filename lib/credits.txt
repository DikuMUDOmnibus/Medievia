Medievia was designed compatible outwardly with the standard Diku interface
but medievia is not a diku mud inside or out.

          DikuMud was originally developed by Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen,
        Hans Henrik Staerfeldt, Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer.

          A small bit of background of DikuMud, according to
        Sebastian Hammer:

        "The game originated at the Department of Computer Science at the
        University of Copenhagen (in Danish: Datalogisk Institut ved
        K|benhavns Universitet; or, amongst friends: DIKU) The foundations
        of the code were laid out in March of 1990. Our background (Mud-wise)
        was primarily Abermud (LpMud was just emerging at the time), and
        our object was to make a better AberMud. We wanted to make it
        fast, compact and CPU-efficient. We wanted to allow more than
        the 18 (or so) players-at-a-time that AberMuds permitted in thos
        days, and we wanted a bigger world, so that players could truly
        get lost in there (back then, 500 room AberMuds seemed the norm).
        Also, we wanted to make it more interesting for players to
        cooperate, rather than just run madly around in search of beasts to
        kill."

The whole mud community, even non-diku types, have been affected by that 
1990 release of diku code.  Since that time, with a fairly stable base 
code to start with, Muds have sprung up all over Internet.  Even though 
Medievia's code is different I doubt we would be here, if diku did not 
make muds such a popular and easy to set up game.  I would like to thank 
the whole diku team for their insight and their passion for the game.

Medievia has been coded and recoded, re-thought and recoded again by 
Vryce over the years.

Our zones have been created by many many gods, many of which no longer 
play the game.

Today Medievia is owned, run  and coded by              Vryce

Long Live Medievia
