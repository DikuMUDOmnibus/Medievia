Scruff~
Scruff, the Mascot of Medievia, is here, looking for bones.
~
Scruff is a scroungy, fluffy, wrinkly little gray dog, wearing a striped shirt
and a pair of overalls. He's very cute, cuddly and I'd suggest you leave him
alone because he can kick your can from here to the other side of Medievia in
no time flat!  Well, actually he's not that cute any more.  His left eye is
nothing but a bloody hole, gouged out in a battle with a vicious Medievian.

the odd animal -- or even itself -- has ripped a chunk away to eat. Thick,
ichorous blood oozes from the wounds. Teeth chatter loudly with the chill of
undeath. Not possessing full control of the body, the corpse is subject to

He looks like he has been missing some sleep because of working on all

and defend himself if necessary.  He tells you to leave his equipment
