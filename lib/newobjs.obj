A set of rules, governing the behavior of immortals has been dropped here.~
               Rules for Immortal Player Behavior
Upon becoming immortal, you are no longer considered a "player" in Medievia.
You simply cannot get killed. Therefore, there are certain rules you must
follow. Knowingly breaking these rules will probably cost you your
characters(s).
 - An immortal must not support ANY mortal playing character in the game,
   including his/her own character. Supporting includes grouping, items,
   money, 'preparing' monsters for easy killing, etc.
      You may occasionally help low-level players by giving them
   small amounts of money or items. You may only give them what is
   buyable in the shops, and never more than 500 gold coins worth.
      Immortals are welcome to take part in the game, by creating
   unexpected (but never unreasonably harmful) obstacles for the players,
   or by providing divine assistance to a newcomer in distress. Usage
   of the 'switch'-command to make the monsters more challenging or
   entertaining is also acceptable - see the rules about harming players,
   below.
 - An immortal is allowed to play other characters, provided that he/she
   does not support them - see above. Beware: It is very hard not to help
   your mortal player, and we'll show virtually no mercy, should we find out.
     Exception from this rule can be made ONLY for test purposes, and only
   by immortals who are actually building or supervising areas of the
   world. Other players should NEVER benefit or suffer from this.
   Test characters should not be a nuisance to other players in any way.
 - An immortal character is not allowed to harm mortal players
   in any way, unless this player is extremely provocative and
   annoying to others.
   Any action taken against mortals should have a VERY good reason.
 - Implementors of Medievia reserve right to change any of the
   above rules.
 - A frequently asked question is what to do after a game crash. In general,
   if people start complaining that they lost stuff, start reimbursing. But,
   just make sure that you're not being cheated (grabbed by the nose, as
   they say in Denmark). If you think you are, just remember that rule that
   'better too little than too much.'
"Any excuse is a bad excuse" - Papi
These are just suggestions:
 - You could hang around talking to other players.
 - You may apply for building a new area in the world of Medievia.
   Send a letter to one of the implementors asking for building documents.
   They will be more than happy to supply you with them.

The Story of Medievia, type look story~
A copy of The Story of Medievia lies here.~
                           The Story of Medievia
The year was 2065, and the planet Earth was finally at peace. All forms of
nationalism had been done away with in favor of a global system of government
and defense known as "The United Earth Council" or "UEC". For the most
part, the people of Earth were content and happy with life on their
planet, few people wanted for much. The global economic system was so
successful that over 980f the population of the planet had jobs, or was
cared for in some way. It was a golden age for the population of this small
bluegreen planet. But it was destined not to last. On January 27th 2065,
the UEC communications satellite in geosynchronyous orbit over Barcelona,
Spain picked up the following deep space transmission...
"...Directive to the infestation inhabiting the third planet of the stellar
system located in quadrant Alpha Delta Five..." the transmission began.
"...You are instructed to stand down all defenses and prepare to be removed
from the planetoid you infest. No resistance will be tolerated. Failure to
comply immediately will result in your destruction!" The transmission ended.
   Two month's later, the UEC had brought together a massive defense force
to protect the planet, comprised of some of the finest fighter pilots the
human race had ever known. Seventy two specially designed fighter
spacecraft were built, and outfitted with the most powerful weaponry known
to man, to prepare for the battle that would take place. Mankind would not
sit still and allow itself to be enslaved by some alien invaders, and this
was it's only hope. The seventy two pilots, and their gunners suited up
and checked over their equipment. They would launch today, and head for
the space station located on the moon, known as Luna-One. From this
location, they would be in a better position to know when the invasion
force would arrive.
   October 15th, Luna-One sensors indicated over eighty incoming spacecraft
coreward. The pilots immediately suited up and hit their ships. And the
battle ensued. With only 12 casualties, the Earth defense force was
victorious. Captured alien technology helped to advance the human race
well beyond it's normal capacity. And humanity thought it was safe again,
but they knew in the back of their minds that if this could happen once,
it could happen again.
   January 1st, 2099. The Earth Defense Force is almost 35 years old now,
and quite a powerful force in this quadrant of the galaxy. Yet other than
a few minor lifeforms, no spacefaring races have been encountered. The
EDF, under the control of the UEC spreads it's search for intelligent life
through the galaxy to include other quadrants of the galaxy. With over 850
Starship class ships to it's arsenal, and thousands of fighters, the EDF
feels confident it can handle any situation that might arise...
   February 20th, 2104... They were wrong... In a fierce battle in the
beta quadrant of the galaxy, the EDF met the forces of the original
invading aliens. Apparently they had only sent a small scout force to
Earth to report back it's findings, what the EDF met with it's three
fleets of ships was more than the entire force could handle. 265
starships and crew, including 5,221 fighters were destroyed in a little
over two hours. And the invasion force did not stop it's slaughter there.
   April 29th, 2105... The alien invasion force reaches Earth, sixteen
thousand ships strong, and completely obliterates the EDF, and lays to
waste over 7817677577377f the surface area of the planet Earth.
   Time has no meaning at this point... What is left of the planet Earth is
barely recognizable, very few humans survive, many are mutants. Some flora
and fauna remain scattered here and there, most of the oceans have been
boiled away, and the atmosphere of the planet is thin enough to allow in
vast amounts of cosmic radiation. The future of the few survivors seems
very bleak.
                                *  *  *
   It is the year 1 of the Loratian calendar, the remnants of humanity
have moved underground, attempting to start life anew. Total population of
the planet, 9,237,412 accounted for members of the Loratian era, which
is a vast underground complex, that spans the globe. Little is known about
this period in Earth's history, except that in the year 210 of the
Loratian calendar, the inhabitants had tunneled so much, and so far, that
they caused their own destruction, the earth caved in on the majority of
the Loratian civilization, leaving few survivors. Those who survived, it
is said, eventually made their way to the surface, to discover a reformed
planet Earth, with lush green forests, wide oceans, and beautiful
mountains and valleys. Oh yes... And 3 libraries!
  It is from these libraries that the remaining inhabitants of the planet
learned of their history, which I now retell to you, and from these
libraries that they decided to carve out their future. Basing their
civilization on what they read in many stories of fiction and fantasy.
Naming their cities, towns, and everything around them, from what they
learned in the books. They taught their children, and their children
taught their children. The books were copied by hand and the people learned
from them. One thing they didn't learn from them was why the magic worked.
But I will tell you... You see, before technology ruled on the planet
Earth, magic was free to reign on the planet, mans mind wasn't so
cluttered with facts and numbers, he was free to believe in things which
were unbelievable. These thoughts, (energy patterns) gave form to the
magic, the magic which you wield, the magic which we all wield. We may
endanger it's existence again one day, if we aren't careful.
                              *   *   *
   The year 1 of the Medievian Calendar. The great city of Medievia is
built, and the people begin to prosper, though not from technology. They
do find that their land is inhabited by strange creatures (mutated
animals, from when the land was exposed to the cosmic radiation), which
they named for the creatures they appeared to be in the books. Dragons,
monsters, Serpents, and so on.. But the human race survived, and expanded
it's horizons, and built around it's city, and grew, and made new cities,
and explored.
   It is now the 799th year of the Medievian Calendar... What you see
around you is what has come of the labor of the survivors of two great
tragedies. Feel free to explore it, discover what you can... But don't
endanger the magic.

Reimbursment Info Paper reimbursement doc document~
Documentation Regarding Reimbursement, type look Reimbursement~
Some documentation regarding reimbursement of characters lies here.~
                        Why IMPS do not Reimburse
                        --- ---- -- --- ---------
This is not to say we never will under any circumstances, this is an
explanation as to why we may not be reimbursing you at this time, or be
reimbursing anyone at this time. The following are the possible reasons.
1. We are unable to verify that you did in fact lose what you say you
lost. It is considered proper practice that "too little is better than too
much" when it comes to muds. Therefore, it's best you re-get what you've
lost, rather than waste your time, and an IMP's looking for ways to prove
you actually lost what you claim to have.
2. The Implementor is very busy, and at any given time, from 2 to 20
people are praying, telling, or shouting at him for help, reporting a bug,
or just wanting to "chit-chat"... It makes it impossible for the Imp or
God to assist anyone, therefor, he or she simply tunes everyone out.
3. We've seen you cheat, we know you cheat, we won't help you.
4. The Imp or God may be writing a message on the board, or responding to
Mud-Mail. In this case, your pestering will only get you in trouble, and
not get you any help.
5. The Imp or God may be logged into the Mud, but not be near the terminal,
and cannot see what you're saying.
6. The Imp or God may be working on a Quest, and wants to devote his or
her full attention to that task. In this case, he/she is considering ALL
members of the Mud, and is trying to help make the game more entertaining
for everyone, so they may tune you out.
7. Special note, just because it says "[1] Gods heard your prayers" does
not mean a God actually DID hear your prayer. Several things can cause
this. 1. There's a god logged in, but they're not looking. 2. There's a
client logged in via a God or Imp's account, running maintenance.
(Auto-Quest, Mail Gather, etc), or 3. The God is trying to ignore you
because he's busy... You might think your problem is earth-shatteringly
important, but no matter what, it CAN wait... It's just a game.
8. You've made a pest of yourself, and the God doesn't want to even know
you exist. (Extreme situation, but some of you guys are a major pain in
the ass ya know!) :)
-In summation... Don't make a pain out of yourself. If a God or Imp logs
into the system, and is available to help, or reimburse, they will
ANNOUNCE IT. If they ask you a question, don't assume this is the time to
start pestering them with your problems. Answer the question, and let that
be that, as the question will more than likely have something to do with
fixing a problem so you don't have to be reimbursed in the future. Bugs
exist, and Unix is an OS with problems... You're going to encounter
crashes, shit happens!
-Addendum... If you have call waiting, TURN IT OFF! If you get
disconnected, come back as soon as possible. The Mud is set to delete all
a player's possessions if he or she does not re-enter the mud after a lost
link (due to crash, call waiting, or your local site going down, or telnet
going down) within a random period of from 60 seconds to 24 hours. This is
the only way it can be fair. Otherwise people will just disconnect, rather
than pay rent. So to be safe, assume that you've only got 60 seconds to
get back on before everything goes... And get back on fast. If it's a mud
crash, you won't lose anything if you come back as soon as the MUD
re-starts. It may take up to 10 minutes for that to happen, just keep at
it. It happens with EVERY MUD from time to time.
End of Document - Please make sure you give this to anyone you see who
hasn't yet read it. If this document popped up in front of you after you
pleaded for help, chances are, the God or Imp was busy, and is giving you
this to let you know that they're busy, and cannot help now, rather than
publically announcing to everyone to leave them alone.

guide newbie newbieguide~
Newbie Guide, type look newbie~
A newbie guide is on the ground~

         Welcome to Medievia!  Leading the way in MUD development!
We want your stay here to be as enjoyable as possible, and to that end, we
have created this small Info Packet to help get you started.
*
*********************   The Prompt   *********************
*
The first thing you should notice is your 'Prompt'.  It will look something
like this.
<22hp 100m 90mv>
This first number [22hp] represents the number of 'Hit Points' that you have.
When you get hit by a monster, you will lose a certain number of hit points,
when this value goes to 0, you will die.  There are three ways to regain
hit points,  sleep, quaff potions, or find a kind Cleric who will heal you.
The second number [100m] represents the number of 'MANA' points that you
have. MANA is the magical energy of Medievia, whenever you cast spells
(if your a Cleric or Mage) you will use a certain amount of MANA energy.
The only way to replace MANA energy is to sleep.
The last number '90mv' represents 'Movement points'.  When this number
reaches [0] you will become exausted and no longer be able to move
around.  There are two ways to regain Movement Points.  The first is to
sleep, and the second is use magical spells.
*
*********************** Hunger and Thirst ********************
*
The next thing you will notice, is that you will soon become hungry and
thirsty.  This is all part of Medievian life.  When you are hungry or
thirsty, you will regain Hit Points, MANA and Movement Points at a very
slow rate.  To satiate your hunger and thirst, you must find the nearest
grocery store, and general store, to buy food and water.
*NOTE*   Waterskins only hold a limited amount of water, and if you drink
         all the water out of it.  It will disappear.  Waterskins, or any
         other container for that matter, must be periodically refilled
         at the WaterFountain.
*
*********************** Other Players *************************
*
Medievia is a MUD.  MUD stands for 'Multi User Dungeon'.  As such, you will
see lots of other players in Medievia, walking from place to place.  You
should talk with them, as they are a valuable source of information and help.
To talk to other people, just type:
SAY <phrase>  Also '  is short for say so  ' <phrase> will also work
Medievians are a kind and helpful bunch of players, and will help you as
best they can.
*
********************** Getting Help ****************************
*

********************** Praying *********************************
If all else fails, and you cannot find the answer to a particular question,
then you may PRAY to the Gods of Medievia.  The format for this command is:
PRAY <question>
*
********************** Channels ********************************
*
There are several channels in Medievia.  You will use different channels
depending on what you want to say, or want to do.  Here is a list of
channels, and their common uses.
Gossip Channel  - Nice for chit-chatting and socializing with other players.
                  This is an EXCELLENT source of information.
Auction Channel - This channel is for Auctioning off EQ that you don't need.
Shouts  Channel - You can shout to all the other Medievians in the game.  But
                  it will cost you 10mv's per Shout.
Quest Channel   - This channel will keep you up-do-date on any quests going
                  on at the time.
Discussion      - This channel is used when a god turns it on(opens it).
                  It is used to discuss the game for development.
To use a channel, simply type the name of the channel, and what you want
to say.  For Example:
GOSSIP Where is the Motel?
QUEST  What quest is going on?
You can turn channels ON or OFF by using the SETCOM command.  The format for
this command is simply:
SETCOM
*
***************** Combat ***************
*
Fighting is an important part of Medievian life.  When you fight, you grow
more experienced.  As you gain more and more EXP, you will become more and
more powerful.  If you are a Mage or Cleric, you will gain the use of more
and more powerful Spells.  If you are a Thief or Warrior, you will gain
the ability to Wield better Weapons and Armor, and you will gain new
abilities and attacks.
Before fighting any monster, you should type CONSIDER <monster>,  this will
tell you the chance you have of killing that monster.
If the battle isn't going very well, and you feel like the monster may win,
you can always FLEE from the battle.  FLEEing is always preferable to dying.
If the monster does kill you, then you will be transported back to the
Castle Square.  From there, you must hurry and find your corpse to get
your Equipment back.  Otherwise, your corpse will rot, and you'll lose
all your possesions.
*
****************** Leveling *******************
*
This is one of the more pleasant things to happen while in Medievia.
When you gain Enough Experience points from combat, you will gain a 'LEVEL'.
When you gain levels, you also gain Valuable Practice Points.  You can
trade in these Practice Points at the local Guild for Spells (If your a
Cleric or Mage) or Skills (If your a Thief or Warrior).  The Guilds are
located on Guild Row.  In the southern part of town.  Type  level  to see
the experience needed per level, your current experience and many other
variables about youself can be seen by typing score.
*
********************* Grouping ********************
*
Grouping is an exceptionally important part of Medievian life.  By forming
groups, you will earn more Experience points.  And you will be able to
kill monsters that you normally wouldn't be able to alone.  To form a group,
first find a couple players who will group with you.  Then, decide who
will lead the group.  All of the other players will then FOLLOW that leader.
Grouping can be complicated at first.  So you should type HELP GROUP to find
out how to do this.
*
*****************  The Hotel  ******************
*
The Hotel is where you RENT your Equipment for the night.  It is the only way
you can quit the game, and not LOSE your equipment.  It is located on
Enterprise Avenue, just East of the Town Crier.
*
***************** Donation Room *****************
*
The Donation room is a place for you to find Items and Equipment that may
help you kill monsters, or survive better.  But be careful, some of the
Equipment in there is Junk.  To donate an item that you find, simply type:
DONATE <item>
*
******************  Hints, and Information  ***************
*
- The first thing you should probably do, is go to the MAP room and look
  at the map of the City, and of Medievia.
- The second thing to do, is to go into the DONATION room.  Here, you may
  find EQ that will help you kill monsters.
- Third, walk around the city a bit, and get familiar with the layout.
  The layout of the city may seem a bit confusing at first, but you will
  quickly learn to find your way around.
- The first monsters you will want to find and kill, will probably be
  Bugs in the tree and Beggars, Drunks, and Janitors.
- You will get More EXP from being in a Group, than you will being Alone.
- Some weapons are MUCH better than others, be sure to ask around as to what
  the best weapon for you is.
And lastly, Enjoy your stay at Medievia.  This is truly an Excellent
MUD.  If you have any questions, feel free to talk to other players, or
talk to one of the Gods.

:::::::::::::::::Medievia  the next step:::::::::::::::::::::::
                    The Place to be!
        In Medievia there are lots of attractions, the Casino,
the Nightclub, local playerkill areas.  We have everything here
at Medievia Cyberspace.
          You will never run out of things to do at the Casino.
At the Casino you can play a nice game of cards with your
friends, try your luck at a roulette table, even play slot
machines and probably win!  There are signs all through the
Casino, one in each room.  Read these signs and they will tell
you how to play the game, or at least the commands.  At a card
table you can play just about any card game, it works just like
a real deck.  You can use Private rooms on the second floor of
the casino, these rooms ensure privacy, even from the Gods!
        There is also some Nightclubs in Medievia.  Places
where players meet for social reasons.
        There are lots of ways to express yourself here,
including socials, emotions, etc.  To get a list of  social
commands, type, 'social'.  You may want to copy this down
somewhere and try all of these out.  If there is a social that
does not fit your needs, you can 'emote'.  To do an emote, you
must first type emote, then what it is you want yourself
doing.  Like this, 'emote smiles in your direction.'  That
would display '<your name> smiles in your direction.'  This is
a very flexible command, and very useful.
        Also in Medievia there are many public channels.
Shout:  'shout <what you want to shout>'
	This feature is under development.
Gossip: 'gossip <what you want to gossip>'
        Gossip is the main chat channel, most everyone is on
it.  Here is where people talk about all kinds of things,
there is no limit really, but you cannot do anything
inappropriate, like swearing, or talking about anything that
would offend anyone.
Auction:
        Auction is quite obvious, this is where people sell
goods that they have acquired.  Like all other channels, you
cannot do anything rash.
Quest:
        Quest channel, this is where people run quests, either
gods, mortals, basically anyone running a quest.
        Note:  All channels can be turned off or on by using
the command 'setcom'.
        Note: <2> People really dislike it if someone is so
unpleasant as to 'spam' people.  Spam is when someone does
multiple shouts, and uses the ! about 50 times in a row.  You
will be warned, after that you may not be so lucky.

Making time in a low rent highrise
No place to go Downtown crushing crucifixion
Particles aching harmful descent take a shot and hide
Subway slam dance stale mattress slow throb bloating
Freshly open grave barefoot beggar..barefoot beggar freshly open grave
Knotted finger turning pages in a book descending
No noise the great trees fall
Calmly through the window see backward elevation
Faded spirit of the gold toothed whore
Moon dances wondering how could this ever be
Kicking the habit Possesion in the flesh
Loves made up melancholy Kicking the habit
Trip back and unleash all anger emerging from
The waterfall branch fork horse rear snorted downward
A vulgar desire playing cards conjured on fly blown
Dimly lit round a room of shadows claw the side
Phantom pinches waking from a dream half eaten candy
From some disordered heaven swirling tastes phornicate
Rotted meat a nested virus feeds eating dish aging
She sits alone in the worry she's created more time
Put aside sorry I'm fucked up inside
Holy hatred Kicking the habit

Long ago, a powerful mortal named Belial, skilled in both magic and the
sword, fell in love with Isis, the princess of a mighty kingdom.  To
prove his worth of her hand in marriage, the king sent him on a quest:
To defeat the Mighty Orcus, a greater god of Hell.  Belial ventured down
to the eigth plane of Hell, where he battled Orcus.  He was unable to
destroy the demon, but he did however force it to flee for a time.  Belial
carved a piece of rock from Orcus' temple... The Bloodstone, which he
returned with as proof of his worth to the king.

book story history~
a book titled "Medievian History; One Historian's Version"~
A book has been left forgotten on the ground here.~
In the beginning.. There was nothing.
Then there was Vryce.
Vryce created the world with his own will. On this world, he planted
the first seeds of the future.  He created humans, the humans were
pampered, their every desire was taken care of by Vryce. But the needs of the
people were great, Vryce could hardly handle the job of tending the needs of
hundreds of people. So he raised certain mortals of great skill to
immortality. They were of a great help to Vryce and their eagreness to
assist helped the people of the world to flourish. The people built a
great city, which alas they named Medievia. The mortals soon grew tired
of such a boring existance, and they took their travelling gear and
explored this new realm. The roving groups eventually established other
cities of Thalos, Rome, and The Vale. But the perfect world was not
destined to remain so. The mortals in thier eagreness to explore and
create, they neglected the gods. So in punishment, the evil gods created
creatures of great destructive evil. The evil gods also sent one of their
own, mornelithe falconsbane to lead them. He created armies of monsters
to wreak havok and devastation across the land. All of the lands great
cities were assaulted. There were great battles.. and many lives were
lost. The people never fully gained control of their land.. but most of
the major cities were saved. -In the last days of the war, Falconsbane was
reduced to a mortal for his failure in subduint the mortals. In his fury,
Falconsbane ordered an army of horrid beasts called Lamias to Destroy the
city and devour alive the fool mortals that reside within. The lamias
followed his orders to the letter. The city was destroyed, and very few
people fled with their lives. Several attempts were made to retake the
city.. All failed. after the war ended medveia entered a dark age, which
mirrored the dissention of the gods. Many of the good gods.. furioous of
the actions of the evil gods.. decided that the world would only lead to
death and destruction if they let the evil gods continue to have control.
In anger they started the great god wars. Horrific wars fought with
creatures of your worst nightmares. In the ned many gods were
annihilated.. vryce eventually gained control, and he made a very
important decision. He decided from this day on .. the gods would no
longer try to control the mortals lives.. but instead allow them to lead
their own lives. the people of medievia had a long road ahead of them..
most of the lands in ruin, and horrid monsters roaming everywhere. It
would not me easy. In their dark age.. the people of medievia made many
advances.. they discovered magic.. In some ways this was good. In others..
bad.. but the magic was not easy to control. several sought it out for
personal gain. Most were smaltime thieves who embraced magic so they could
gain money. Others for power The most notorious.. was the evil mage
horneg. He had a lust for power that would prove nearly impossible to
beat. He travelled far and discovered a lonely graveyard. With his magic
he twisted and warped the land until every stone, every twig, dripped with
evil. He mutated the animals within until they were almost demonic in
appearance. They were deadly to the extreme. The king of Medievia sent a
mighty army to stop him. And his forces met defeat at the hands of hornegs
monsters. The king was remembered saying "this is a dark day for
medievia.. The demons of thanos have arisen. And their leader.. is but a
fool mortal named Horneg. Horneg spend many days preparing the final
spell that would summon demons he could use to destroy medievia. But in
the final words of his spell .. A young cleric called upon her god to stop
Horneg regardless of the cost. Her god answered.. Altering his spell.
instead of merely raising demons to help him.. he raised the demons
temple. From that day forth.. The demons of what was being called
Bloodstone despised the mage for his audacity in bringing them to this
world. The land of Medievia managed to come out of the dark ages on top
thou. They launched the mighty ship Mystara; and her mission? to explore
the lands. They discovered many differend lands.. and many of them
inhabited. Friendly ? Hostile? Nobody yet knows. That is the story of
medievia.. But is this the end? Or is this the beginning? Neither. This is
merely the end of the beginning...

Clerical Anarchy : The way of the bastard~
An very old leather bound book lies here covered with dust.~
      Clerical Anarchy: The ways and thoughts of the ruthless bastards.
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
     By Anonymous, and inspired by his (anonymous's)patron god Gothic,
                     the original ruthless bastard.
---
	In the beginning, there were clerics. Clerics that sat at their
desks all day reading scriptures and chanting this and that. One would
get up, sing; wash themselves, sing; and all that good stuff, and more
singing. Chanting had begun to get a bit old and the great churches of
the land required something new to control their clergy with. One
particular morning, a lowly priest known only as Gothic wandered into a
small monastery north of the port city Medievia. Gothic happened to have
one particular feature that stood out amongst his others. His height.
Gothic stood at over 250 centimeters tall, and when I say tall; I MEAN
tall. The monks of the area took him in has their own and raised him to
be a proper cleric. Proper was the last thing this great man was destined
to become. As Gothic stood next to the pond in the back of the church one
morning, he saw an injured duck land face down in the dirt. The silent
giant walked towards the bird, picked it up and took it inside. As he
walked through the door, the other clerics in the room gasped at him.
Animals were not permitted to be brought inside the walls of the
compound. Gothic knew this rule well. Gothic could have cared less. This
was only the first step in his slow decent into what we call today
"bastardism."
---
The day after the duck incident Gothic was seen doing his daily chores
with the animal constantly at his side. It's been said he was even heard
speaking to the duck. As the day wore on, Gothic let his new-found pet
roam around the church alone, and as you may guess... No one was pleased.
That very evening the head of the monastery... Monk Meanie, came to
Gothic's room. The hooded short guy started to speak in harsh words
towards our gigantic hero (yes, he spoke, they didn't have vows of silence
then. It just wasn't done.). As the man spoke and spoke, Gothic got
angrier and angrier. Finally, the priest stood up, towering over the monk
in a very threatening pose. He blared out at once...
"I find your irritating chanting reprehensibly offensive and I will no
longer take part in it. Furthermore, my duck will remain with me at all
times. Understood?"
  The monk snapped back with, "My friend, you will not issue the facts. I
will. As long as I run this place, you will never have a place in any
clergy anywhere!"
  With that, Gothic stood up, grabbed his duck and left. He never
returned to that monastery or any others again. Legend tells us that
Gothic pillaged and plundered, using the powers granted him by demons and
underlords whom were pleased with his sins against the church. The
"cleric" took up residence outside of Medievia with a band of friends
known as The Death Corps. The group went around destroying whatever they
found and leaving it in a total and utterly chaotic mess. Especially
humans and the like.
  The legend of the first ruthless bastard ends here. Turn the page when
you hear a beep.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philosophies of modern bastards.
---
1.No one is better than you till you have been beaten by them.
2.No one is less than you until you have beaten them. Over and Over and Over.
3.Treat your friends and loved ones with the ultimate respect and generosity.
4.Treat your enemies and your enemies friends with the ultimate disrespect
and hate.
5.If an enemy tries to become a friend, treat him with respect until he has
given you reason to doubt him.
6.If a friend becomes an enemy, dismiss him completely from your mind
until he attempts to bring harm to you or anyone you wish not to be harmed.
7.If an enemy does not slander you, do not slander them. You will only look
the fool.
8.Don't smile unless smiled at.
9.Do not tolerate any form of "butt-kissing, boot licking, kissing up,
browning nosing, and the like." It is a sign of weakness.
10.When and if you must kill, kill like you mean it.

THE FARE
...
It was just another day on the road.  Not a particularly good day, but I'd
made a few bucks.  There were some real assholes on the road ... I dont
know who gives these people their fucking licenses, but they need a
shotgun enema, I can tell you that much.
...
I remember vividly a blue Ford cutting in front of me, driven by some old
numb- cunt bitch, almost sideswiping me.  The people on the road
nowadays. It just really makes me wonder sometimes.
...
Well, I was cruising, looking for a fare.  It was starting to get dark.
Night was setting in, and I was tired and bored.  I could feel my eyes
stinging from the harsh glare of the streetlights.  Maybe it was time to
call it quits.  I could use a rest.  Call it a day.  Not a good day, sure,
but an okay day.  No need to be greedy.  Time for a rest, and a good cup
of coffee.
...
Fuck it ... dispatch was quieter than hell anyway.
...
I was just turning into the darker sidestreets, that I know so well, when
I saw him.  Just a flash of black in the corner of my eye.  He had his
hand raised, gesturing at me urgently.
...
A fare, here in the lost back streets, of all places.  I pulled over to
the side of the road and muttered, 'Get in, buddy'.  I heard the door
close behind me, so I put her into gear and started driving.
...
"Where to, friend ?", I asked, glancing into the rearview mirror.
...
He didnt answer.
...
I studied him, only half watching the road ahead of me.  A tall, waspish
man. Early forties.  Arrogant, angular features.  Pallid skin.  His face
was pale and impassive.  He was wearing a ratty black coat, and looked
bleakly out of the window, watching the road pass him by.  His balding
head gleamed mellowly in the streetlights.
...
"Hey buddy ... where to ?", I repeated my question, letting my annoyance
show in my voice.
...
He looked up at me.  Our eyes met in the rearview mirror, and I felt a
strange, sudden shock tremble through me.  A feeling, almost of forebody
crept up the length of my spine.  This fare could be trouble.  Bigtime.
...
I suddenly remembered reading about some guy who liked to kill cabbies
down in Melbourne.  Garrote.  Cut deep into the poor bastards' throats.
Gooseflesh rippled down the back of my neck.
...
I stopped the car with a screech, and turned to confront him.  No fucking
freak was gonna garrote me in some backstreet.
...
I leaned over the seat and glared at him angrily.  I was suprised to see a
sad, almost gentle smile on his face.  Looking into his eyes, I found
myself dimly wondering how I could ever think that this man could be
capable of hurting anyone.
...
But isnt that the face common to all goddam psychos ?  I read the news.
There was this one guy who the media called "Babyface Jack".  Liked to
kill little girls.  Not just kill them, though .. fucker would remove and
eat their lower intestines.  I remember that the reporter has seemed
particularly disgusted by this.  As though there were more appetising
parts of the human body.
...
"Listen, mate.", I began....
...
He interrupted me by reaching forward and taking my hand.  I
stared aghast as he pressed a hundred-dollar bill into my palm, and firmly
closed my fist around it.  His eyes met mine, and I could see the hidden
desperation in them.  He interrupted me by reaching forward and taking my

...
"Take me to wherever I am going." ...

The Fare (continued...)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
His voice was cultured, intelligent.  I looked down at the hundred in
disbelief,and fingered it.  It felt real.  I made a decision and quickly
tucked it into my breast pocket.
...
"Sure mate, whatever you say.", I said, and started driving again.
...
Fucked if I was going to refuse a fare like that !
...
We drove for almost ten minutes.  I was cruising aimlessly, trying to
figure it
out.  We didn't speak.  He just looked sadly out the window.
...
"So where do you want to go, friend ?", I asked.
...
He looked up at me through the rearview, and I was stunned to see a sheen
over his eyes.  The wierdo was crying like a fucking two-year-old.
...
There was no response.
...
"Look mate, just tell me what you're after, and I'll fix it for you"
...
I figured he wanted a whore or something.  I know a few.  He was strange, but
I really wanted to get my hand on another of those bills.
...
I coughed nervously, to get his attention.
...
"Anywhere is fine !", he almost shouted.  "I'm sick of all of this .. this
going nowhere .. just drop me off anywhere .. I dont care anymore."
...
I was getting nervous, and looked for a place to pull over.
...
"I'm tired.", he said vaguely.
...
"You wanna go to a motel, pal ?", I asked hopefully, keeping my eyes
carefully alternating from the road to the rearview mirror.
...
Again, silence, as he shook his head.
...
This shit just wasnt worth the hundred bucks.
...
He smiled at me strangely.
...
"Do you believe in God ?", he asked.
...
"What the fuck ?"
...
He looked at me expectantly again, smiling as if he knew what I was going to
say.  His eyes still looked lost and desperate.  I pulled up at a red light,
and turned to face him.  I glared at him.
...
"No.  I dont.  So what ?", I spat.
...
He was still smiling that wierd, sad smile.
...
"God is dead.", he intoned solemnly.  "And if he were alive, he'd be
running a weight-loss centre, or hosting a game show."
...
I threw the cab into gear, and started driving again.
...
The traffic was suddenly overwhelming.  The blare of horns deafened me.
The bright lights of the city strobed, sending dark fields across my
vision.  I could smell the city's stench.  The man continued to blather
behind me.  I kept driving slowly, wishing I were somewhere else.  In the
corner of my eye I saw a raggedy homeless man, his toes poking out through
the end of his sneakers.  He was holding a dirty placard, which read,
'Will work for food.'
...
I felt lost, and not sure where to go, even though I know the streets like
I know every cigarette-burn in my bed.
...
The freak in the back seat was just not helping at all.
...
I wanted to punch his fucking lights out.  Instead I found myself reaching
for the money in my pocket, and throwing the crumpled bill at him.
...
"Get out of my fucking cab !", I roared.
...
He nodded sadly, and slid across the back seat, opening the door.  He
picked up the bill, and handed it back to me.  I tried to give it back,
but he ignored my movement, got out of the cab, and closed the door gently
behind him.  He walked through the traffic to the side of the road, and
was gone.
...
I watched for a moment, entranced by the sidewalk.
...
Dry concrete.  Cracked, scarred.  Inviting.
...
Then I put the cab into gear, and kept driving.

A Dream
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A vision of a world
obscure
clouded by the shadows
of my mind
and thoughts impure.
A world in which dreams
are not only free
but encouraged
Souls flourish
rather than wither
and die.
...
An affinity for kindness
evolved from a world
of light
and the smiling wisdom
of youth
not embracing the night.
Fearless in the ability
to face fear
unhindered
by the blindness
that illumination brings.
...

Unamed Poem
----------------------------------------------------------------
You measure your wealth
by the things you can hold
and you measure your love
by the sweet things youre told
and you live in the past
of a dream that your in
and your selfishness
is your cardinal sin
...
And you want
to be held with highest regard
it delights you so much
when theyre trying so hard
and you try to conceal
your ordinary way
with a smile
a shrug
or some stolen cliche
...
But dont you understand ?
Dont you look about ?
I'm trying to take
nothing from you
so why should you act so put out ?
by me ..
...
Cause emotionally
youre the same basic trip
and you know that I know
all the times that you slip
so dont try to impress me
its just a coat of paint
and dont try to charm me
with things that you aint
...
And dont try to enchant me
with your manner of dress
because a monkey in silk
is a monkey no less
and measure for measure
reflect on whats said
and when I wont see you
then measure it dead
...
But dont you understan ?
dont you look about ?
Im trying to take nothing from you
so why sould you act so put out ?
and sit there
in wonder and doubt ?
over me ...

Unamed Poem
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Was it a huntsman
or a player
that made you pay the cost ?
that now assumes relaxed positions
and prostitutes your loss
were you tortured
by your own thirst
in those pleasures that you seek ?
That made you Tom the Curious
that makes you James the weak
...
And you claim
youve got something going
something you call unique
but I've seen your soul
to be showing
as the tears
roll down your cheeks
...
Soon
you know Ill leave you
and I'll never look behind
cause I was born for the purpose
that crucifies your mind
so con/convince your mirror
as you've always done before
bringing substance to shadows
giving substance evermore
...
And you assume
youve got something to offer
secrets shiny and new
but how much of you
is repitition ?
that youve been whispering to him too ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mayor hides the crimerate
councilwoman hesitates
public gets irate
but forgets to vote
HATE
weatherman complaining
predicted sun
its raining
everyones protesting
society keeps adjusting
but youre not like all of the rest ...
...
Garbage aint collected
women aint protected
politicians using
the people theyre abusing
the mafias getting bigger
like polution in the river
and you tell me
that this is where its at
...
I woke up thismorning
with an ache in my head
I splashed on my clothes
and I crawled out of bed
I opened the window
to listen to the news
but all I heard
was the establishment blues
...
Gunships
they are soaring
housewives find life boring
divorce the only answer
smoking causes cancer
the pope likes population
freedom from taxation
teeny-bops
are uptight
drinking at the stoplight
miniskirt is flirting
I cant stop
so Im hurting
spinster sells her hopeless chest
...
Adultery
in the kitchen
bigot cops rule fiction
little man gets shafted
sons and money drafted
living by a timepiece
new
or in the far east
can you pass the rorschach test ?
...
Its a hassle
its an educated guess
well frankly
I couldnt care less

~
LOO reimb~
All level 33 and 34 gods are required to do their share of reimbursing.
If Vryce sees you becoming wizinvis and hiding from mortals regularly,
you will be purged/demoted. Reimbursing takes common sense, there will
always be the player who tries to get a false reimbursement. Reimburse
equally and fairly. Vryce does not require you to LIKE or APPROVE of the
mortal you are reimbursing. Look at the player's level, their online time,
ask the player where they got the iten from. Most times full reimbursements
are given, but the player is required to KNOW the exact item they had, and
the entire reimbursement should take no longer than five minutes. If you
notice that the same player keeps asking for reimbursement, check to see
if there is a bug. If none is found, assume the player is lying and make
a note to the rest of the gods not to reimb that player.
~
LOO stat~
Setting stats on players and mobs should only be done with a VALID reason.
If you find it necessary to set a player or a mob's stats, make sure that
you send a letter to vryce explaining exactly what you did and why. If
this is discovered in the log, and there is no letter of explaination,
You will be purged.
~
LOO level~
Once you reach level 31, there is ONE way to level. Vryce advances you
to do a certain job. Any player level 32+ will need to do some basic
work on Medievia. Level 32 players are required to show up regularly,
at least weekly. Level 33's are required to be a MAINSTAY on Medievia,
to show up often and work. Level 34's will only be made to fullfill a
very important job. Level 35's are required to pretty much DEVOTE
themselves to Medievia.
JOBS: All players level 32+ are given work to do by vryce. They are
required to work to keep their immortal status. Once you finish a job
another will be assigned to you. We tailor GODHOOD to be a blast, a lot
of fun, but there is work to be done.
~
LOO privacy~
SNOOPING, SWITCHING or being INVIS to undermine a player's PRIVACY: There
are only a few valid reasons to do this, one is if you think a player is
using a bug to better their character, another is to watch what a player
is doing while reimbursing, perhaps asking which eq they should try to
trick you into giving them.
Although Medievia has a clause saying that all messages, actions, tells
and going on's in Medievia are open to the public, we do TRY. All God
commands are logged and checked weekly, you will not get away with
undermining a player's privacy. If you need to snoop a player, see a
GOD first, unless you are absolutely sure you have a valid reason. If
you snoop someone without seeing a GOD first make sure you godsend a
note explaining why and who you snooped. If you are caught snooping
and there is no letter, you may be approached by a GOD and be required
to explain. If a valid explaination is not given you may be purged.
~
LOO abuse~
Abuse of your Godly powers is very serious, if it is discovered you
use your powers in unethical ways you may be removed from the mud.
Abuse is, but not limited to:
	* Using your abilities to 'settle a score'.
	* Using your abilities to give any mortal an unfair advantage
	  over others by providing cash, bars, potions, eq, etc.
	* Using your abilities to invade the privacy of others. (This
	  includes snooping during card games.)
	* Using your abilities to force players to do anything that
	  would compromise the status of their character.
	* Using your abilites to TRANS ANY PLAYER TO A NECROMANCER.
note: Loading a necromancer wont work, only the code loaded ones can
      revive an undead corpse.
~
LOO punishments~
The GENERAL punishments available to Gods are:
	BAN : disallow a site to login. This should only be used
	      in extreme cases since others from that site will
	      be banned as well.
       KILL : this will act as an instant kill from a mob, the
	      victim will lose exp and be turned into an undead
	      corpse. This should be reserved for serious offenses
	      such as multiple offenders.
      PURGE : same as kill except victim will not lose exp, they will
	      simply be disconnected and their eq left behind to let
	      them come back for, or to purge, depending on the offense.
	      This is a good command to use if someone refuses to give
	      up eq they stole, obtained illegally, etc.
     FREEZE : this is the mildest of the punishments. The length of time
	      the player is frozen should reflect the severity of the
	      crime committed. The player will not be able to issue any
	      commands, use this if a player gets "huffy" with you.
~
LOO favoritism~
Definition of favoritism:
	Any use of your abilities to do things for one player you wouldnt
	do for another. - SEE ABUSE
There are players out there who try to gain the friendship of Gods purely
for special favors. Keep an eye out for this, dont be fooled into thinking
you HAVE to do something just to keep a friend.. this just proves they are
not really your friends. Novelty items once in awhile such as nachos, beer,
and things of that type are fine if not overdone.

book handbook~
the Handbook for the Recently Deceased~
a dusty book with a unusual cover lays here~
The answer to life?  That's easy, 42.  Want to know about death?  Read
on.
...
Q: What's going on?  This never happened before!
A: Since their arrival in Medievia, Necromancers have gained incredible
power and now rule the underworld.  They derive this power by stealing the
sprits of dead Medievians.  Without their spirit, players are doomed to an
existance as an undead corpse.  If you're lucky enough to find a necromancer
lurking about you can try to kill him to reclaim your spirit. This is not so
easy since corpses are weak and Necromancers are very strong.  However, with
the divine assistance of the Magic Code, anything is possible.  If you remain
undead long enough, you can go to the holy place and pray to the God of the
Magic Code who will bring you back to life and forgive some of your player
kills.  The amount of time you remain undead depends upon your number of player
kills and upon how long it takes you to find and kill a necromancer. For each
pk, you will have to wait 10 extra minutes before the god of the holy place
will answer your prayer.
....
Q: What is this "holy place"?
A: There is one place on each continent where the god of the Magic Code
will listen to your prayers and bring you back to life if you are deemed
worthy.  If you are not in the proper place or your time is not up your prayer
will go unanswered. One holy place is The Highest point of Medievia on the top
of Mount Vryce, up from the waterfall at the northern end of the River Carthein.
The other holy place is at the Altar of the Great One in the city on the far
shore of Lake Contnea.
....
Q: How do I find a Necromancer?
A: Necromancers like to move throughout medievia waiting for hapless Medievians
to die so they can prey on their corpses.  Occasionally, one will move,
sneaking up on some monster.  The Monster will shout a warning. If you are
listening to shouts, and are familiar with the denizens of Medievia you
should be able to locate one without too much trouble.  If you're not
that familiar with Medievia, then being an undead corpse is the perfect
opportunity to explore.
....
Q: Where is my stuff?
A: After you died, you hovered over your PC's corpse for a few minutes
watching what was going on around you. Since you had infravision and could
detect invisible, you were able to watch in case anyone looted your corpse.
After the necromancer stole your spirit, your character and equipment was
saved.  When you come back to life, you will be normal and have all your
equipment except what you lost to looters.
....
Q: What happened to me?!!!
A: You are no longer a normal player. You are an undead corpse monster.
An NPC. Your rotting flesh stinks and you're aquired some rather vile personal
habits. The sight of you is enough to make even the stout hearted scream and
flee in terror.  You are very weak and the 2000 pound iron ball you're shackled
to ensures that you'll never be able to pick up anything.  You can use the
normal communications channels, but cannot talk to clan members or use shops,
locker, atm or the post office.  Since you're a monster, you can move around
without other monsters attacking you, but since you're weak, you can't carry
keys to unlock doors you may encounter.  Players are also unable to attack you.
The only way you can fight is if you attack someone yourself.  This is
rather futile though since you have 0d0 damage.  The only thing you can hurt is
the necromancer when you are fighting for your spirit.
....
Q: What good am I?
A: In some parts of Medievia your flesh and blood are considered delicacies.
Most people however have weak stomachs and although they find you filling,
they can only stand the thought of uttering the words "eat flesh" and
"drink blood" only if they are *VERY* hungry or thirsty.
....
Q: What happened to Neutral PK?
A: Neutral PK is still the same except that now you wake up in a rather
unusual place.  NPK victims will not turn into a corpse.
....
Q: What about newbies?
A: The Magic Code takes pity on newbies and doesn't let them acutally die
until level 5.  Before then, they are merely teleported to the Tourist Center
without the bother of making a corpse.
....
Q: Help!  I'm stuck!
A: If you're totally stuck, try quaffing your vial of unholy water to
teleport out of danger.
....
Q: How can I participate in PK quests?
A: PK quests are held in the arena.  Player kills that occur in the arena
are not counted in your total.  All other chaotic and neutral pk's are counted
tho, so be careful about who you decide to kill.  The time you remain undead is
based on your number of player kills.  If you're a mass murderer with 500 pk's
you will remain undead for 5000 minutes or 3.5 days real time.  If you and your
friends want to have fun killing each other, go to the arena or be prepared to
pay the consequences.
....
Q: I have to leave!
A: No problem.  You can quit from anywhere in the game.  Your timer is saved
and when you return you'll reappear in the graveyard and pick up where you
left off as an undead corpse.

Q: Why does everyone run away from me?
A: Come on!  Have you looked in a mirror lately?  You're revolting!!! Only the
blessed have the fortitude to look upon corpses and never feel queasy. If the
unblessed find you too offensive, they might hire a cleric to bless you.

that pulse with un-life. The staff itself is intelligent and harbors its

When Vecna, the archlich, grew in power he appointed a most evil and

henchman was the lord, Kas, and for him Vecna found a weapon of potency.
A sword of unsurpassed hardness with sharp point and keen edges, and
magical properties.  For a long, long time Kas faithfully served the
lich, but as his power grew, so did his hubris, for his Sword was
constantly urging him on, saying that Kas was now greater than Vecna
himself, and with the might of the Sword to aid and direct him, Kas
could rule in Vecna's stead.  Legend says that Kas did indeed attempt
the destruction of the lich.  Vecna wrought his rebellious lieutenant's
doom, and the world was made brighter thereby.
