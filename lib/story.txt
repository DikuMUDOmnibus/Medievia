			 The Story of Medievia
 
	      On the 20th day of March, in the year of 412.
 
   In the beginning, there was nothingness, the unmainfest had yet to spread
it's vastness into that which is, from that which is not. And the elders
had not yet found the seed from which all things are borne. And then the
first one came, and beheld the nothing, and sowed the seed of imagination,
and thus was born the first glimmer of the light which was to be the great
existance of Medievia. Later others came, the Elders of the watch, the
great writers of the book of lore. And they sowed their own seeds into the
land, and it became rich, and fertile. And the one knew it to be good. And
it came of form. And in the second passage of time, did come the land,
laid across the nothingness like a great blanket by the elder of the
highlands, and from his high place, he saw the land was whole and one. And
he did call on another to create items, and the non-living, to breathe
adventure into the land. And in the third passage of time did come the
maker of the items and non-living things. And he did breath existance into
the things which are seen and unseen. And from his land in the southern
regions, he could see that it was whole, and one, and he did call on the
living things, to come forth, and adventure in this new land. This land
called Medievia, where the strange things wander, and the imagination
flys. And in the fourth passage of time, did come the living things, to 
partake of the grand adventure. And they proclamed it "pretty cool dude!",
and the elders were joyous! Thus became Medievia, the land of adventure, 
where the adventurers come to wile away the hours.

And then we had you guys call and you played here. The end. 
 
Journey now, into a world reformed, a once-Earth, half broken, fragile blue
ball known as, Medievia...
