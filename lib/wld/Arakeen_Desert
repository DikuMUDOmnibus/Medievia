The Arakeen Desert~
The sand is rather shallow here and there is a sheet of rock under it.
A hot wind blows in your face and you think it has a scent of sea
water on it.  Looking west you notice the desert ends abruptly here and
at a steep cliff.  Looking down over the edge you can see a small beach and
a great ocean stretches out in the distance.  There doesn't appear to be
any way down the sheer cliff wall.

The Oasis~
You stand in a lush oasis in the middle of the Desert. This place
is filled with all kinds of plant and animal life, as well as a
large spring, which supplies the water neccessary to support the
life here. The spring feeds a lake to the south. There is a large,
rather unusual looking cactus here, on the west side of the oasis.

cactus~
The cactus towers before you. It is well over 100 feet tall, and
is apparently very ancient. Birds have nested in its branches.

You are wandering a vast, blisteringly hot desert.  The heat rising from the
white sand blurs your vision and the sweat running down your face burns your

A small beach~
You are standing on a beautiful white sandy beach.  The crystal clear,
sparkling water of the ocean washes up on the shore in a neverending cycle.
A few shells can be see in the sand as well as some birds circling the
water looking for food.  You can see a small island on the horizon of the
ocean.  The north, south and east directions are all blocked by an enourmous
cliff which reaches up towards to the sky out of view.

A hot wind blows in your face and you think it has a scent of sea
water on it.  Looking west you notice the desert ends abruptly here and
at a steep cliff.  Looking down over the edge you can see a small beach and
a great ocean stretches out in the distance.  There doesn't appear to be
any way down the sheer cliff wall.
