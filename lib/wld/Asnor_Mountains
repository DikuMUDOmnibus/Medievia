I love snow, and all the forms of the radiant frost;
I love waves, and winds, and storms, everything almost
Which is Nature's, and may be untainted by man's misery.
I love tranquil solitude, and such society as is quiet, wise, and good;
Between thee and me what difference? but thou dost possess
The things I seek, not love them less.
I love Love--though he has wings, and like light can flee,
But above all other things, Spirit, I love thee--thou art love and life!
Oh come, make once more my heart thy home.

Paradise Lost - Gothic~
As once I wept, if I could weep, my tears might well be shed,
To think I was not near to keep one vigil o'er thy bed;
To gaze, how fondly! on thy face, to fold thee in a faint embrace,
Uphold thy drooping head; and show that love, however vain,
Nor thou nor I can feel again.
Yet how much less it were to gain, though thou hast left me free,
The loveliest things that still remain, than thus remember thee!
The all of thine that cannot die through dark and dread Eternity
Returns again to me, And more thy buried love endears
than aught except its living years.

A Deserted Camp Site~
You come across a small clearing here enclosed by two large boulders
that help keep out the cold wind out. A campfire burns brightly here
and helps warm you up a bit. Some supplies lay about on the ground.

journal~
 The journal reads: After scouting out the underground caverns I have
discovered grave news. The trolls are mounting an army to attack the temple. I
managed to squeeze some information out of a rather friendly troll (ha! who
would believe such a thing would exist) who glady sold me the information for
some fine wine. It seems some group of Dark Mages have an aggreement with the
Trolls, they provide magical weapons/spells for an all out assault on the
temple in return for the corpses of all their slain victims. The troll was
rather unsure what purpose the Mages had for these dead bodies but it said he
believed it had something to do with human blood. If what he says is true...the
temple is at risk. I pray to the gods that I am able to evade the troll patrols
and return to the temple with this news.

detailed account of how the evil Mage Caolabhuinn was corrupted by black magic
as a student. And how his obession with death magic and controlling the dead
forced his childhood friend Breedan to destroy him on the Asnor mountains.
The last passage in the journal mentions Caolabhuinn final words, he vowed to
return from the dead and unleash a reign of terror upon the world. Enslaving
all with his evil magic.
It also mentions how Breedan oversaw the construction of this great temple to
keep watch in the event that Caolabhuinn was able to hold true to his vow.~

Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,

Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire

In the beginning how the heavens and earth
Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill
Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed

Sun 3rd,249 Day of Thunder -
I have been approached by a hu-man mage named Anntoin. He has offered to bring
me the hu-man who is responsible for the death of my father provided my army
assist him in a task of his. Something about the revival of his mentor and
needing the blood of fresh dead hu-mans. This betrayl of his own kind does
not surprise me considering the foul nature of hu-mans. I will help this
Anntoin...the more dead hu-mans the better until I have the one responsible for

Guard Outpost~
You enter a grimly looking guard barracks. Small cots are lined up against
the wall, the bedding on them look like they haven't be changed in years.
A shelf on one of the walls contain what looks like skulls of victims who
had the misfortune of coming across the guards.

I fear that I have brought upon the world an evil that so vile that the devil
himself would be shriek in disgust. Several months ago I was approached by
a young man seeking the to be my apprentice, he had claimed to be interested
in healing magic to help in fighting a dreaded disease that was spreading
in his small home town of Masliar. What a fool I must have been to believe
his tale. Several weeks ago I caught him searching my library, he had found
my hidden lab where I had been performing experiments of dealing with the
nature of the dead, I had sought to somehow wrench away the power of the
Necromancers and their control over the dead. I attempted to question my
young apprentice when he chanted the spell of Changing and transformed to
reveal his true self....he was not even human, but instead some horribly
disfigured winged creature. He looked at me and laughed, his bright red
eyes peering down at me, tho I have seen many things in my life time, I must
admit that I myself felt the twinge of fear creeping up along my spine.
Quickly I attempted to hurl a spell of fireball at him which struck him
square in the chest, but he simply laughed before drawing up his huge
razor-life hand slashing me in the chest...even now as I lay here in a
pool of my own blood I feel my life slipping away. It is my hope that by
writing this that someone...somehow will see this and heed it's warning.
The creature must be stopped...the magic I had been working on was to
perform good works, but in the hands of a foul creature such as this much
destruction can be wrought. I fear that the creature may try and use this
magic to bring back to life Caolabhuinn, to whom this this creature race
once served.I can only hope that the dragon I have animated can guard well
it's treasure...a amulet which would unseal Caolabhuinn's crypt.

their overwhelming numbers the Paladins should have beaten back the attack.

to spy on Caolabhuinn in the hopes of learning what foul deed the evil
mage has in the works. Alas my magic has failed me and I was captured by
the mages evil henchman. Using what magic I had left I have attempted to
escape by use of the earthquake...all of naught for I not have the
strength to continue the work. Being a captive here has brought some good
news...I have learned of the depraved mages plans...he has mastered the
dark magics and with it the secret to immortality. He is attempting to use
this foul knowledge to make himself and Mirada immortal, and together with
the other dreadful dark magic raise an army of the undead to conquer the
world, making himself king and Mirada his queen. I must somehow inform

I fear that I may have destroyed my friendship with Caolabhuinn in
professing my love to Marisa despite knowing full well of his feelings
for her. It is with more then a little ashamed that I admit I have
betray my dear friend...but my heart could not bare to lose my lovely
Marisa. Caolabhuinn has sworn that he would not rest until Marisa was

food lay scattered about the floor and on the walls (and even some on the
ceiling). Trolls are not know for there cleanliness.

Paradise Lost - Icon~
And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands
The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath
Blew for a little life, and made a flame
Which was a mockery; then they lifted up
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld
Each other's aspects saw, and shriek'd, and died
Even of their mutual hideousness they died,
Unknowing who he was upon whose brow
Famine had written Fiend. The world was void,
The populous and the powerful was a lump,
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless
A lump of death a chaos of hard clay.
The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still,
And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths;
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,
And their masts fell down piecemeal as they dropp'd
They slept on the abyss without a surge
The waves were dead the tides were in their grave,
The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before;
he winds were wither'd in the stagnant air,
And the clouds perish'd Darkness had no need
Of aid from them--She was the Universe.

Paradise Lost - Shades of God~
She walks in beauty, like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies;
@And all that's best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellow'd to that tender light which heaven to gaudy day denies.
One shade the more, one ray the less, had half impair'd the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress, or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express how pure, how dear their welling-place.
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, so soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,but tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below, a heart whose love is innocent!
