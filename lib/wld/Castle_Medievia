The Castle Stairs~
You are on a grand staircase made of white marble. There is no railing, just
steps spiraling upward towards an island of land. A huge chunk of earth
looks as if it were torn from the ground and now floats above the City of
Medievia. Far below you can see the city square and above you the stairs
end at the entrance to a majestic castle on the island.

Before the Castle~
You are standing atop a huge staircase, stretching down hundreds of feet to
the City of Medievia.  This landing is on the edge of a giant island in
the sky.  In front of you is a magnificent castle, made of silvery-white
stone, gleaming in the sunlight.  It has many high towers and spires of
various heights.  A wide dirt road leads north to the castle's drawbridge.

On the Drawbridge~
This is the main entranceway into the castle courtyard. It spans the
twenty foot moat which surrounds the entire structure. Made of thick black
wood, the drawbridge is wide and strong enough to support several horsemen
side by side as well as large, heavy siege equipment. A high arched doorway
stands open before you, providing passage through the castle's outer wall.

The Castle Courtyard~
This is a large courtyard in front of Castle Medievia. High, stone walls
are built on the east, west and south. To the north stands the majestic
castle itself, gleaming in the sunlight. The ground is mostly dirt with
little patches of grass growing sporadically. The courtyard continues to
the north before ending at the castle doors. There's an open doorway built
into the west wall, about ten feet wide and easily as tall. Looking up you
see the battlements surrounding the walls.

marble, occupies each alcove. The ceiling is curved, forming a half
cylinder. Tall torch holders have been placed in between each alcove
and provide a flickering light, causing strange and haunting shadows.

Some appear to be mundane but most have been kept in pristine condition

A square table rests in the center of the room with a large, glowing orb
hovering above it, illuminating the entire room. A padded leather chair
is pushed in under the ornately carved stone table.

small diamonds and golden studs.  A low table in front of the fire is
accompanied by three large chairs forming a semicircle around this hearth.
In the middle of the room is a larger table with an oversized silver dish.
The silver platter holds several delicious pieces of ripe fruit.  In the
southwest corner a steep and narrow staircase leads up into the darkness of
the ceiling vault, fifteen feet above the floor.  In the center of the east
wall is a spiral staircase leading down.  There is a computer here.

have been destroyed, completely, and now the upper portion remains, floating
in mid air above a lush green courtyard below.  A jagged-edged hole in the
spire's outter wall lies directly behind you, only a few feet away. The
ledge has crumbled away further to the north, making it impossible to

south, the hallway turns into a tunnel, going under one of the second story
passageways. It has an open wall above this staircase which provides
passers-by with an unobstructed view of the room to the north.

and to the west the floor is completely gone, just air and clouds hover in
the empty space of the chamber.

Elaborately carved bedposts have been crafted in the shapes wild birds
one an owl, a hawk, a raven and an eagle. At the four corners of the
bed, adjacent to each post, silky red candles are set atop narrow wooden
pedestals.
A large chest rests on a table in the northwest corner of the chamber.
On the east wall a finely rendered painting depicts a beautiful young
woman with long, brown hair; her green-blue eyes flicker with passion and
love. The figure in the painting is clothed in an embroidered velvet robe
of a magic-user.

your view follows the River Carthein as it weaves through dense forest on
both sides.  Even farther, the majestic Mt. Vryce stands impassively at the
source of the river, piercing the clouds.  At each cardinal direction, a thick
column rises up seamlessly from the spire's outter wall and form a tall point
over this platform, more than twenty feet above your head.  The echoing of
a lion's roar can be heard in the distance.

going east-west. Looking down you start in terror and awe. You are magically
suspended over a great vortex. gray swirling mist spins rapidly, creating a
great funnel cloud. Powerful bolts of lightning streak from the sides and
explode with sparks and flames. Spectral images and windows to other worlds
appear and disappear in an instant on the surface of the churning mists.

of the room, measuring at least twenty feet in diameter; and many chairs
with comfortable padding on the seats arranged around the table.

stone. Platinum chains hang from the ceiling, about five feet, with large
spheres of flame attached to the end, burning brightly. The magical flames
produce no smoke and brightly illuminate the passageway. The air is musty
and irritates your lungs as your movement stirs up dust. You have an eerie
feeling about this place as a chill runs up your spine.

A Majestic Stone Corridor~
This is an enormous hallway, more than fifteen feet wide and at least twenty
feet high. The walls and ceiling are made of polished, charcoal colored
granite. The floor tiles are hexagon shaped and made from a dull silver
stone. Platinum chains hang from the ceiling, about five feet, with large
spheres of flame attached to the end, burning brightly. The magical flames
produce no smoke and brightly illuminate the passageway. The air is musty
and irritates your lungs as your movement stirs up dust. You have an eerie
feeling about this place as a chill runs up your spine.

you see the great god Vryce calling upon the magical forces of creation
as a vast swamp and forest rise up at his command.  A huge tapestry hanging
on the south wall illustrates several gods and goddesses standing around
a cowering lesser god as he is consumed in scorching flames.  One painting
on the western wall catches your eye, it is of the mortal heros, Khanan
and Pipeline, battling the arch lich Vecna in a frenzy of steel and magic.
You shiver a little as the eyes on the painting seem to follow your movements.

move slowly. The floor is sloped and covered with loose gravel and rubble.
Stumbling along, you can barely see more than a few paces ahead of yourself.

In Mid Air Above a Courtyard~
Being extremely brave, and perhaps quite stupid, you step out the window onto
nothing but air. The wind starts to rush up past you when your fall is suddenly
halted. The shimmering outline of a bridge appears beneith you, saving you
from a brutal, and very messy, demise. Two tall, round towers rise up on the
east and west sides of the bridge. This bridge leads to a stained glass window
in the side of each spire. Looking through the sparkling, wispy image of the
bridge, you can see a courtyard filled with lush trees and exotic plants.

The Hall of Statues~
You are in a long, wide hallway, running north and south. The walls are
made of light gray granite, rising fifteen feet, with several small
alcoves along the east and west walls. A life size statue, carved from
marble, occupies each alcove. The ceiling is curved, forming a half
cylinder. Tall torch holders have been placed in between each alcove
and provide a flickering light, causing strange and haunting shadows.

Medievia War Room~
You walk into a massive chamber made entirely of stone.  Several tables and
chairs have been placed around the room.  On all the walls hang huge
tapestries woven into maps of many lands, some not even found on this plane
of existence.  One prominent table in the center of the room displays a scale
map of the entire continent of Medievia; you stare in awe at the intricate
detail. Empty suits of armor stand on display in each corner, polished and
kept in excellent condition from ages past.
You see a large table with a deep bowl shape dug into its solid granite
center. Inscribed on the table is a sign.

You are on a large balcony, extending from the front of Castle Medievia.
The floor is made of white marble tiles and has been kept clean and new
looking, despite the weather and passage of time. A waist high railing
surrounds this semi-circular platform, also made of white marble. The
posts are ornately carved as are the banisters sides, with a wide, flat
top. Looking out, you see a stunning view of the castle courtyard and
surrounding floating island. Further out, you can see the entire city of
Medievia as well as the countryside stretched out before you.  Decorative
ivy is growing along the wall above you, reaching upwards.

This is a dark stone tunnel, leading straight up and down.  A spiral, metal
staircase has become rusted from the damp air and creaks loudly as you
step on it.  The walls of the cavern are smooth which betrays this was
created by someone and is not natural.  You can see a faint light above

Several stained glass windows have been placed in the tower walls, spiralling

This glass art work gives you the perspective of standing on the edge of a
cliff, looking out over the edge.  There is another cliff face across from
you and a deep ravine between them.  At the bottom of the cliffs is a lush
jungle fed by a cool stream of sparkling water.  You notice an almost
invisible bridge connecting the two cliffs, the outline is sparkling in the
sunlight.

There's another tower to the east, not as tall as the first but very impressive.
It has no base, it appears to be broken off in the middle and the top
portion is hovering in the air.

In a Round Tower~
You are on the inside of a tall, hollow tower reaching far into the sky.
Looking down you can see into the small forested area below the floating
tower. You cautiously procede along the ricktey old staircase protruding
from the wall.  Glancing upwards a strange feeling of vertigo comes over you
and you press your back against the wall to help navigate the steps.  A gust
of wind picks up and blows from the open bottom of the tower past you,
compromising your balance and your life.  Several window frames dot the walls
all around the tower, most are crumbling and appear to be nothing more than
gaping holes now.  One beautiful stained glass window on the western wall
appears to be undamaged.

In a Round Tower~
You are on the inside of a tall, hollow tower reaching far into the sky.
Looking down, the outter wall crumbles and ends just a few feet below you.
The upper portion of this tower floats magically above a small, forested
courtyard. You cautiously procede along a rickety staircase protruding
from the wall. Glancing upwards a strange feeling of vertigo comes over you
and you press your back against the wall to help navigate the steps. A gust
of wind picks up and blows from the open bottom of the tower past you,
compromising your balance and your life. Several window frames dot the walls
all around the tower, most are crumbling and appear to be nothing more than
gaping holes now. Looking out the lowest one on the eastern side, you can
see the wall of the castle proper and a small ledge surrounding it.

You are on the inside of a tall, hollow tower reaching far into the sky.
Looking down you can see into the small forested area below the floating
tower. A narrow wooden catwalk surrounds the top of the tower here. Above
you, the half-destroyed roof comes to a point. Large holes have been ripped
in it, allowing you a view of portions of the sky on the other side. A gust
of wind picks up and blows from the open bottom of the tower past you,
compromising your balance and your life.  Several window frames dot the walls
all around the tower, most are crumbling and appear to be nothing more than

You have your body pressed up against the side of a round tower to keep from

growing around the edges and continuing down the side of the castle.  A slight
breeze wisps through your hair, sending shivers of panic down your spine.

Base of a Spire~
This is the main living quarters of a large, round tower.  Over-sized chairs
and tables occupy one side of the room, positioned around a huge fireplace.
The chairs are covered with plush fabric and bowls of fruit and large mugs
rest atop one of the tables.  Two men could easily sit side by side in one
of the chairs, all the furniture here seems to be sized for a giant. On
the other side of the chamber are a few book shelves and a stone work table.
A few books have been left open on the table next to some alchemy equipment.
A fifteen foot diameter hole has been cut in the ceiling, leading up to another
chamber.

Tip of a Spire~
You stand atop a tall, round tower protruding from the castle's roof.  A
small, waist-high wall surrounds this circular landing.  You can see the
vast, majestic lands of Medievia in all directions from here.  A light
breeze blows through your hair as you stare a few moments in awe at the
inspiring landscape.  A few hundred feet to the west, at the corner of the
castle, are two spires, reaching even farther into the sky than this one.
A large, circular hole leads down inside this tower.

In a Spire~
This is a large, open chamber inside the hollow spire.  Several windows,
large enough for a human to stand upright in, are placed symetrically
around the walls.  A large pile of multi-colored feathers sits against
the southern wall, under one of the windows.  To the north is a large
table made of dull, black wood with a matching padded chair; both appear
to belong to a giant.  Many torch sconces are bolted into the walls about
ten feet off the ground, glowing with a warm blaze.  A large hole in the
center of the floor leads down to the main living chamber while a matching
hole in the ceiling leads up to the roof.

All the walls of this chamber are made of stone.  A massive table of
black granite sits in the center of the room, neatly arranged on its
surface are vials and alchemy equipment of all kinds.  Small shelves
line the walls, stacked with books used in magical research.  No dust

A Dark Cavern~
The walls of this cavern are rough and jagged, causing you to stoop over and
move slowly. The floor is sloped and covered with loose gravel and rubble.
Stumbling along, you can barely see more than a few paces ahead of yourself.

The Castle Stairs~
You are on a grand staircase made of white marble. There is no railing, just
steps spiraling upward towards an island of land. A huge chunk of earth
looks as if it were torn from the ground and now floats above the City of
Medievia. Below you can see the city square and far above you the stairs
end at the entrance to a majestic castle on the island.
