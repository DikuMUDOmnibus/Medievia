The City of Medievia - Castle Square~
Here is where all journeys begin, here is where you stand at the stairs of the
great Castle Medievia, from here, all things are possible, and all things
begin. You see a large set of marble stairs leading up to the drawbridge of
Castle Medievia from where you now stand. To the east is the Donation room,
where fellow kind players will leave items for the beginning players, to the
west is the bulletin board, where you may leave public messages, to the north,
the Great Altar of the Gods, and to the south a fresh spring-water fountain.
If you're feeling lucky, or angry about something, there are some stone stairs
that lead down from here. They head to the Arena, the only area in the city
where you are permitted to kill your fellow players without penalty.
There is a sign here, carved from fine hardwood.

The Altar to the Gods of Medievia~
The stone floor continues no farther north, ending in a small wall made of
stone. Looking out over the structure you can see a great river stretch
out to the north.  A huge mountain can be seen far off on the horizon.
You stand at the Altar of the Gods, here you may make sacrifices if you wish...
Acceptable sacrifices would include anything you might wish to donate, please
type "donate <item>". You can do this anywhere in the world, but doing it here
may bring you a special sense of protection by the Gods of Medievia.
The great river Courrain runs through the middle of the room from north to
south. Two waist-high walls have been built on either side of the river.
There is a plaque mounted on the stone wall here.

Precautions for River Travel and Information for Travellers.
The River Courrain winds through the land of Medievia, and passes by the City
of Medievia at this point, travelers should be advised that there is a bit of
a current to compensate for.  Be sure you are in proper physical strength
to handle the journey, as many a wayfarer has been lost to the perils of the
wilderness.  Along the banks of the river Courrain, one can stop off at an
exotic jungle island upstream.  Farther northward, the source of the river
can be found high atop Mt. Vryce.  Other adventures await on the river,
please have fun, but be sure to take care not to wander into any pitfalls.

Walking along this cobblestone path, strange trees lines the walking path
to the side.  You catch an occasional smell of burning oil.  Small
posts with hanging oil lanterns glinter in the darkness.  A janitor is here
putting oil into a few lanterns.  Overhead are balconies dropping down
to block the sun's rays.  People are running around frantically looking
for a quick sale.  A few traders pass by.  A street sign says

Medievia Central Square~
This square marks the geographic center of the City of Medievia. North and
South, Main Street runs through the city, while Enterprise Ave. runs East and
West here.
An enormous tower, made of black marble streaked with veins of crimson,
rises into the sky from this square.  The structure is round, narrowing
somewhat at the top.  At the base of the tower, a shimmering golden
portal hovers.  An arched doorway extending a few feet from the tower's
base covers the magical passageway.
You may gain entrance to this tower by typing: enter portal.

A Bend in the Road.~
A slight bend in the road brings forth a new path.  The bricks
used for this row seem quite cost worthy for they are shiney and
a pristine glow reflects from them.  A street sign to the

plaque~
The Plaque reads:
Important Information:
   Citizens, there is a vast Labyrinth located southeast of our fair City,
in the midsts of a marshy wood. Many evil and agressive monsters roam the
halls.  At the end of the Labyrinth is the Goblin Castle, where you must
face the dreadful Goblin King. A word of warning, the Labyrinth is tricky,
and there are no landmarks. You must try to make your own landmarks, (if
you can), and find your way through. Monsters await you, and there are zones
which will throw you wildly off course, so you could be in here for a while.
Be prepared! To make things a little easier on you, an Armor Shoppe, Weapons
Shoppe, Food store and Apothecary are also provided within the Labyrinth.
Good luck, and may the gods smile on your quest.
                                         Hoggle - The Keeper of the Labyrinth
P.S. Please close the gate behind yourself!
P.P.S. Don't drop individual coins or objects of the same kind repeatedly to
mark your trail, as this has a deadly effect!

The Level 31 Tree House~
You stand in a large tree house. The house seems to be suspended by a
magical force since there is no tree under it. A rope ladder leads down
from the hatch in the center of the treehouse to the park below. The
hatch glows with a shimmering blue color, it obiously must be some kind
of magic portal. There are a couple cots in the corner for the homeless
heros, but most of the place seems to be one huge display case. Off in the
corner there is a large commerative Vecna display case, it is full of
bloodstones, tshirts and other various Bloodstone memrobelia. All the display
cases are guarded with the Special SuperElite MedWatch Security system so
don't even think about stealing anything. In the center of the room, there is
a large wooden table where you see several heros discussing their adventures
over some mushrooms and pepsi. What a great place!

 of empty kegs sit lined up against the wall, but you see
 a couple of full ones on the table next to you.  On it
 also lies a rack of fine cheeses and wine.  You can't
 help but start to drool profusely.

Hall of the Neue Regel ~
You step into the shadows of this large hall.  Strange music seems to be
coming out of the darkness.  Listening closely, you hear bits and pieces
of the lyrics, "... I will light the way for us to find - order of a new
kind - join us on the stay - the road is mine! ... I can hear the chimes -
ringing for you for me ... I can feel its time - come together hold the
light - keep the flame we can't let this world remain - the same! ... It's
time for the world to hear - Neue Regel is here!"  You pause a moment,
wondering what kind of changes the inhabitants of this hall must have in
mind for the world.  Your eyes shift to the center of the room focusing
on a small flame burning brightly beneath a crystal sphere.   Stepping,
closer, the images that fill your mind blend with those that are now
flickering in the crystal.   For one, shining, brief moment the world
seems to be in order.  You stretch out your hand to touch the sphere...
and it's gone.

keeps a small crystal shard suspended.  The column seems to give the room much
of it's light.

The Tailor's Shoppe~
The sultry smells of leather, tanning oils and amber incense fill
the warm air of this shop. Leather goods of all kinds and conditions
are hung randomly over the walls of the entrance. The place is lit
by several gold-colored candles crowded onto a small round table in
the corner, and an old rug of foreign origin covers the floor.

This long room contains documents of identification and certification
along its walls.  A large orb stands in the middle magnetising to
your chest for some reason.  In the back you see an old man doing his
daily skills to keep up his warrior attributes.  The local children
stand in awe watching him practice his skills and weaponry. Here
you can practice your attributes, Strength, Wisdom, Intelligence,

Coven House~
You are standing in a house of sanctuary.
Wood planks on the floor and the walls are
covered in green vines and wild flowers and there
is a strong aroma of apple blossoms in the air.
Lit candles cast romantic shadows around the room and
over huge cushions on the floor for you to sit down, relax
and socialize.  In the back corner of the room you see a stone
fireplace that heats up the room with a blazing fire.
You feel very much at home here.  When you peer out the
window, you see you are surrounded by a shield of
shimmering silver mists.

wouldn't be so bad after all.

The Secret Underground~
You stand under Ashton Park, in the Secret area under Medievia. Very few
people know of this place, and even fewer still know what lurks down here.
Some torches line the walls in this place, they are lit, so it's safe to
assume SOMEONE comes down here.

The Secret Underground~
You're lost in the secret underground! There are some stairs that lead up here.
Apparently, this section of the underground isn't used very often, since it is
very dark down here, and there are no more torches. It's cold, damp, and just
a bit scary. This part of the underground doesn't look man made, it resembles
a cave more than a tunnel system.

Castle of Pain~
Upon entering this castle, you are overwhelmed with the horrors to come forth.
The castle itself looks ancient and mysterious.  The high vaulted ceiling is
supported by marble columns laced with gold vines and silver leaves.  Such
beauty can only be made by the nature loving race of the Elves.  The floor is
tiled with smooth heavy stones.  These stones must have been carved by the
ancient race of the Dwarves because they fit together perfectly with a grey and
black tint.  Despite the beauty of the structure, you see the horrors painted
on the walls!  Futher to the south, you see a path of blue and green grass
leading to a very bright and luxurious palace.  You wonder what nobility lives
in there.

The eastern wall shows an Overlord mounted on top an Ancient Black Dragon slaying
an army of warriors and thieves.  Blood and death littered across the land.
The western wall shows a powerful Wizard and a High Priest dueling.  Lightning
extends from the wizards fingers while a column of fire from the sky protected
the High Priest.  A huge Fire Elemental is also fighting a Greater Demon.  Both
creatures seemed to be controlled by the powerful Wizard and High Priest,
respectively.

Shadow Wolves Living Room~
You enter a comfortable room with a large open fireplace. Couches and easy
chairs form a semicircle in front of the fire and bookshelves line the
walls. The Crest of Clan Shadow Wolf hangs above the mantle.
There is a trapdoor in the corner leading to the Treasure Room.

Majik's Living Room~
   This is Majik's living room. As expected, posters of Queensryche
vie with images of naked, well-endowed women for wall space. All the
furniture is leather-upholstered, and there is a MASSIVE stereo
and speakers along the east wall. Everything looks sturdy enough for a real

Heavenly Moments~
As you step through Heavens Aura, you suddenly feel as if you are floating..
Candles all around you add a soft, embracing light to the room. You can hear
the faint hum of music in the background, or is that the sweet hum of love?
In the centre of the room is a huge waterbed, and you can see where Moment
and Jorel have spent their Heavenly Moments...

the pillows thrown on the floor.  On the other side of the room is a
recliner, well worn from frequent use.

As you fumble about the room looking for a light switch, you notice

flick the light switch on, the bright colors in your clothes and the
stars and stripes on the American flag which covers the ceiling begin
to glow a purple tint. On the shelf on the north wall, you see various
items stolen from all around the world. Near the southern corner you
can see a statue erect of the great war hero.

Mole's House~
This is a modest room decorated in tasteful tackiness.  There are a few
black and white photos of winter on the walls.  A large and comfortable
couch has been claimed by a very large and comfortable black cat who
winks at you waiting to be petted.  A few other slightly beaten chairs
set around a cluttered coffee table are free.  In the corner, away from
the light, is a large fish tank with three cute and happy plecostomi
dancing away to the music playing in the background.  To your left you
notice a large vase full of roses resting on a table.  Their scent fills
the air, pleasant, but not cloying.  A patch of earth colored shadow
gapes beneath the coffee table.

The Temple of Power~
You stand in a huge structure made of pale black stone. Currents of
darkness swirl about you, fuzzing the walls and distorting your
sense of time. In the center of the room the floor opens up into a
perfect circular portal, as wide as a man is tall. Thick mist rises
from it, spreading slightly as it climbs in a plume towards a hole
in the ceiling. Cloaked, hooded figures pace slowly around the
portal, chanting in a forgotten tongue. The chanting resonates with
the strange stone walls, and the air about you hums with energy.
The figures ignore you as they continue their ritual, its purpose
unfathomable.

A Void Bubble~
You stand inside a bubble made of the same primordial energy as the Void.
You can see hardly anything and you hear as if someone has shoved three
cottonballs in each ear. There is no breeze and the air feels palpably dense.
You also seem to move very slowly as if you can't help but drag your feet.
Then again, you really have no clue how far you've come!

Mousie's Game Room~
This room is filled with Mouser's best video games ever.  Oldies such as
Mr. Do! and Speed Rumbler... and recent stuff such as SFA and Project Viper.
Mousie' favorite game flashes in front of him -- 1943. Other gaming
systems and peripherals... barely notice some toys and games -- but they'
of the two- (maybe more!) variety... and is hidden between some
tabletop games. Guess those were meant for when his desired company arrives.

The House of Legolas~
As you enter this anything but humble abode, you're shocked by the amount of
gold and precious items that lie strewn about on the floor.  You can only
dream of owning such treasure. As you glance upwards you are appalled by the
trophies hanging on the walls: dragon's heads, stuffed to perfection, and
scalps of every hero the world has known. Set against the north wall is a
portrait of the master himself.  You quiver in terror as he returns your
stare.  Maybe its time to leave, for the master will return shortly!

A beach house~
You are in the living room of a small, but cozy and tastefully decorated
beach house.  The floor is carpeted with a soft, light grey rug.  White
marble tile is arranged in a semi-circle at the entryway to the south.
The ceiling starts out at eight feet high where it meets the north wall and
rises up on a slant as it approaches the southern wall till it reaches a
full twenty feet.  The top portion of the south wall is lined with windows,
brightly lighting the room by sun or moonlight.  A black L-shaped couch
occupies the center of the room, along with a marble coffee table.  A small
fireplace is built into the northeast corner for those chilly beach nights.
Facing it is a comfortable futon couch.  A spiral staircase is in the north-
west corner, leading up to the bedroom.

================================
CIRCLE OF POWER NEW MEMBER SHEET
================================
This is just a short summary of the goals of the Circle of Power Clan.
If you have any further questions, just ask a member of the clan.
Goals:
1) To work toward a friendlier and better MUD environment.
2) To help newbies in any way we can in the form of coins,
xp, items, advice, or protection.  These are to be given
sleep deemed and never in such a way that it imbalances game play.
3) To help Clan Members in need by providing clan funds and supplies.
Clan Philosophy:
1) Clan Members MUST help a newbie if they are being harrassed or
attacked by another player.  The point of this is to keep newbies
in the game.  Without them, we are nothing.  Newbies help us to
grow. Without newbies a Mud will eventually die out, we are here
to make certain that does not happen.
2) The Circle of Power will not participate in clan wars, however, we
will defend ourselves and allies if attacked.  We will NOT, however,
instigate such an incident.
3) The Circle of Power does not condone Clan "bashing" as all Clans
have a purpose, and a right, to exist.
~
E
enrolling~
1) New members should be at least 15th level, unless they have a higher
level character or are sponsored by a Command Council Member.
2) New members must first be sponsored by a member of the clan.
3) New members then must seek the approval of a Command Council member.
This must be obtained before a vote can be taken.
4) Once approval of a Clan Councilor is obtained, then all clan members
present in Medievia at the time will then vote.  If the new member
is approved by this vote, he/she/it then becomes a probationary
Clan Member.  This allows the new member to call upon the clan for
defense, but nothing else.
5) Then the new member will be assigned a quest by a Clan Councilor,
usually the First Officer.  This quest must be completed alone.
6) Upon completion of this quest, the new member will then be ordained
by the Clan Leader in a short ceremony.  The new member will then
be a full Clan Member and shall enjoy the rights and privileges
that such status grants him/her/it.
The Clan Leader has final say in new membership.

rules~
RULES
=====
These are the rules which all Clan Members must observe, and
new rules may be added as needed.
1) No call for help from a newbie is to be ignored unless very busy.
2) If in any case it is necessary  to  provide  a  newbie  with
equipment, the said equipment must not severely unbalance gameplay.
3) A newbie is 10th level or less.  Beyond which, the charecter
will no longer  be  considerered  a  newbie  and  thus,  the
Clan Member is not obligated to help the charecter.   A Clan
Member can still assist this character as a friend.
4) In times of crisis and danger,  Clan Member's are expected to
band together to face the threat. Any newbie being similarly
threatened is to be protected.
5) A  newbie is to be informed of which  zones  they  are  being
brought to.   Newbie zones  are  to be shown,  and  dangerous
zones are to be pointed out.
6) The Clan does  not  condone  unwarranted attacks against other
clans or players. Do not endanger the Clan by being involved in
such activities.

Gods and Goddesses Office Building - Reception Room~
You stand in a very large, expansive reception area in the Hall of the Gods
and Goddesses. In this room you see a large, odd shaped doorway, made out of a
metallic looking substance, on top of the doorway is a sign which glows a
bright blue that reads "Please type ENTER to return to the world of Medievia".
To the north you see a pair of metal doors, that slide open in the center, and
inside is a small room. The floor in this room is a smoky marble material
that seems to pulsate with energy, the walls are non-descript, with many
pictures, painting and murals around. A large desk, apparently made of another
form of metal sits in the center of the room, it is circular in shape, with a
woman sitting inside the circle.
ENTER to return to Medievia.

Offices of the Gods and Goddesses - First Floor.~
You are in a huge reception room.  The floors and walls are made of
a smokey gray stone which seems to fade out of existance unless you
look directly at it.  The ceiling is lost from your view, hidden by
endless shadows.

Office of the God Wakim~
You have entered a room that glows with a black light generated by four
large torches, whose flames are like shadows. Beneath you lies a rug woven
with incredible intricacy, and on closer inspection you notice a strangely
familiar pattern to it. You surmise that the rug is woven from countless
human nervous systems, and each step you take causes an agonized scream
from one of the damned souls woven into the rug. Besides the torches hung
from the walls, there are also several paintings which depict huge battle-
fields strewn with corpses. At the center of the room a small tree is
growing, its branches form a gossamer punctuated by thin silver leaves.

Dragos' Private Suite~
Large Marble Columns line the room, A Fountain flows in the center of the room
the water bubbles peacefully.  Green Palm trees stand on both sides of the
marble columns. Cultivated flower beds line the east and west walls filled
ferns and other lush plant life. A large teak wood desk sits at the south end
of the room. On the Desk sits a computer, on the screen is a message flashes.
Behind the desk sits a Corrinthian leather Swivel Chair. A Picture of Dragos
hangs on the wall. In the picture Dragos holds a sword in one hand and an
a shield with a holy cross on it. Under it is the ancient in scription,

Pug's War Room~
This is where the Medievian War God used to hold his battle conferences.
There are, however, a few relics left behind. In the dust are a huge skull,
a book, a desk of dark wood and a shield leaning against the far wall.
   Pug (relic that he is) is not currently lying in the dust.

desk~
This desk is HUGE, and is constructed of the darkest ebony you have ever
seen! The top is covered with an extremely hard green slab, and the front
and sides are intricately worked with fine silver inlay. There are a total
of six drawers in the desk, the middle drawer being lockable.
   The desk glows with a deep, intense aura.

book~
As you look at the many books on the shelves, a particularly worn volume
catches your eye. The spine reads: Dirty Deeds from the Dawn to the
Destruction -- by A.O. Death
   You here quiet, constant laughter from the book.
~
E
shield~
You notice that one of the shields on the wall still emits a faint aura!
The shield itself is black and non-reflective. As you notice the symbol
on the shield, your blood runs cold! It is the image of a red, lidless eye!
   Although the eye was cloven with the shield, you feel it still follows
your every move!
~
E
skull dragon~
The bleached-white skull is that of an immense dragon. It looks like it was a
tough kill when it was alive. It has two long, sharp horns and fangs that
average 8 inches in length. The bone is at least 2 or 3 inches thick, but
there is a gash near the neck where it looks like a sword sheared clean
through it!
   As you look at it, you feel it may still be alive!

Reception Area - Offices of the Greater Gods - 4th Floor~
You stand in a room that beguiles you with it's size and majesty. The room is
decorated in gold, silver, precious gems and jewels, and many fascinating
artifacts. A HUGE desk, about the size of a small home in width rests in the
center of this spacious area, and a stoic looking gentleman sits behind it,
paying very little attention to you. If you're here, you must have important
business with a greater God of Medievia. Must you not? There are 3 doors
behind the desk to the north, east and west.

This is the area where those who wish to speak to Firm are asked to wait until
he is prepared to see them.  The room is furnished with comfortable couches and
several copies of the current Medievia Mudslinger are available to assist those
who wait in passing the time.  The artwork on the walls shows Firm's taste of
German Impressionist art.

You slip from Charis's office to this tiny garden. You are amazed at it's
simple beauty. Truly a place of serenity, miniture trees and shrubs are
in full bloom, the smallest of flowers carpet the whole area. One large tree
dominates the corner, and you feel sure that it's spirit is beckoning
you to rest under it's benevolant branches. This is a place of magical beauty
and you almost expect to see the Faeries dance around your ankles.

Penthouse Level - Reception Area~
You are awestruck by the incredible majesty, size, and wonder of this room.
The ceiling is so far above you that it is simply a blur of gold, silver, and
magnificent artwork... 7 Diamond chandeliers, with ruby, sapphire and emerald
accents, worked in gold and silver, hang from chains of fine silver, like a
spider's web, impossibly thin and delicate, from the far off ceiling.
The floor is a marble design which you would never have believed possible, a
pure white color with exotic swirls of subtle colors run through it. In
various places throughout the room are some lovely rugs of the finest
materials and designs. On the far off walls, paintings only the gods
themselves could have created hang. In the center of the room stands a huge
black oblisk, which occasionally pulsates with a dim color. There is no
reception desk, to the three directions spanning the distance are 3 great
doorways, worked of fine hardwoods, precious metals, with gems and jewels
worked in the metal and wood. On each of the doors is a gold plaque, with
words engraved in pure holy light.
Exits: North, South, East, West - You can look at the doors. (LOOK DOORS)

Dragos' Waiting Room~
As you enter a large Reception area, You notice rows and rows of chairs in
each chair is a skeleton covered in cobwebs. In what used to thier hands is a
piece of paper. You look at the paper and cringe in terror this one piece has
the number 1, A sign on the wall says please take a number. You take
a number it says 1, You have the feeling it is going to be a long wait.
So you might as well get comfortable, A decrepid old Secratary hollars, "Now
serving Number 2!" You have the feeling it may be a while, try making an
appointment with Dragos directly, just might be a good Idea!!

The Office of Vryce - God of Programming!~
Vryce's office is a complex thing, which your mind cannot grasp... Numbers and
symbols float through the air in abject complacency. The walls shift and fade,
and snap to crystal clarity, the floor is there, and then it is not. The
ceiling is a butterfly, and yet it's a photograph of nothingness... You loose
touch with sanity for a moment, and SNAP! You close your eyes, and settle your
stomach... Reality is mixed with things you cannot comprehend... Chaos and
Order have no hold here! That which is, is a joke... You laugh... That which
is not... becomes!
This is the realm of the Programmer... It's psychotic!

The office of Most Heavenly Beauty, the Goddess Rebecca!~
You step into a whole new world... The air is fresh, the ground is lush and
green... Songbirds sing their songs in the branches of expansive trees, which
lay down their arms across softly flowing rivers, as if to brush away the
world's woes. Flowers bloom at the base of immense mountains, which kiss the
the blue sky, as the orange bloom of the sun sets itself to rest in their
valleys, sparkling the atmosphere with a spray of pink effervecence. Small
animals make their home here in peaceful tranquility, and the lion lies down
with the lamb in the field... This is the office of the Goddess of Beauty,
Rebecca.

Top of a Marble Stairwell~
You are in a massive stairwell, leading down. It is nearly fourty
feet square, sinking down hundreds of feet into darkness. Carved stone
steps protrude from the wall, spiralling downwards. Strange orbs,
a foot in diameter, float in the center of the shaft. Each one

The loft~
A loft that overlooks the main room below.  To the north is windowed
wall and you have a breathtaking view of the mountains.  There is a
fouton in the corner and a few lockers off to the side. The place
makes quite a cozy bedroom.

A wooden sun deck~
This is a large wooden deck attached to the south side of a small, but
beautiful, beach house. With nothing overhead, it provides excellent
exposure to the sun throughout the entire day, as well as being a perfect
place to gaze at the night sky. Several lounge chairs have been placed
along the deck with their backs to the house. Sand dunes block the view
to the east and west, giving you privacy. You can see the top of much
larger house over the dunes to the east. A sandy path winds its way to
the south.  A small mailbox in the shape of a dolphin stands on a post by
the side of the house.

A small library~
This is a small, private library. Most of the wall space is covered with
shelves and lined with books. A fireplace is built against the western
wall, made of black bricks with a polished slab of black marble for the
mantle. A large, valenwood desk is positioned in the middle of the north
wall, its surface clean of papers and other clutter; a comfortable leather
chair is pushed in under the desk. A window occupies the southern wall,
providing a serene view of the beach's dunes, and on the horizon, the
sparkling ocean.

The Treasure Room~
   After descending the rough hewn stone stairs, you come to a windowless
room guarded by two of the largest Dire Wolves you have ever seen. Hung on
hooks around the walls are more weapons then you have ever seen before in
your life. Suits of armor are placed on man-shaped dummies in the corners.
Various magical items lay in chests.
   You feel that if Stormchylde knew you were here, you wouldn't live
very long to explain why. You hear heavy steps coming down the
stairs....you better leave....I think he's home.

You find yourself in a high-ceilinged, granite-walled room.  On a dais in
the middle of the room looms a fourposter bed.  Shelves carved into the
north wall are lined with tomes of War and Magic.  Filling the south wall
is a mirrored wardrobe and, to your surprise, a crystal tank filled with
scores of delicate, jewel-like fish.  The only light comes from the east
wall--from an enormous fireplace flanked by millioned, floor-to-ceiling
windows. On the floor, in front of the raging fire, lies a silver white
rug of wolves' fur.  Above the mantel is a fierce display of gruesome
looking weaponry.

A Mole Hole~
This huge hole is just jam packed with random clutter stashed in cracks
and crevices lining the walls.  Protruding roots make nice candle
holders and bookshelves, as well as places for old socks.  Farther down
the tunnel, against far wall, a huge bookshelf stocked with Mercedes
Lackey books leans crookedly away from Claude, the giant inflatable
emperor penguin.  A queen size futon, a butterfly chair, and two bean
bags make up the furniture squeezed in among old clothes and toys.
Displayed randomly around the room are a few mementos from past
excursions: a staff of wonders, Shandril's silver amulet, a framed
picture of good old Lews, and finally Eldritch's old 10d2 +4+5 enchanted
shortsword.

The portrait locks behind you.  This room houses a fair number of tables
and chairs.  Playing cards litter the floor.  The room reeks with the foul
stench of ale and herbs, reminding you of that time in Afghanistan.  On the

chamber rising several feet above the rest of the floor. Atop the platform is
a magnificent altar made of a strange glowing material. Hovering above the
altar is a large throne made of adamantite and inlaid with jewels. This is
most likely where Shalafi himself oversees the unholy services of his
followers.

You stand in the middle of the waiting room of a busy public health clinic.
Its extremely overburdened because there are so few health care options in
Medievia. All manner of creatures inhabit this place. You see bats and
beggars, shadow riders and gryphons. In one corner is a whitecloak with a
bloody longsword protruding from its back. In another, a nurse in an
asbestos suit wipes the nose of a dragon with hay fever. All of a sudden
there's a commotion at the front door and two attendants from the Horneg
Clerical Service bring in their fifth victim today. The poor devil has
a huge bloody wound oozing blood all over his back. It looks like Nightmare
is at it again.

The City Stables~
The mild scent of clean hay and well-kept horses reaches your senses as you
pass into the stables. Obviously the stable manager keeps himself busy.
The bridles, harnesses, saddles, blankets, and other equipment are hung
in meticulous care on polished brass racks, spare shoes arranged by size
dangle from pegs on the west wall, brushes and other tools set neatly in
folding trays, and feed in bails in back of the stalls, away from the long-
reaching necks of the fine breeds who shelter here.

Machine's Room~
You are in Machine's Antechamber. A litemist fills the room. To the south is
Garthran's home and to the North is Fast and Christie's. High Tech Electronic
panels cover the east and west walls. You notice a flashing screen on the east
wall. After closer inspection you realize different areas of Medievia scroll
by. There is a sign above the screen. It reads MTS... Mob Tracking System. On
the west wall in a dartboard with a picture of a medievian god on it. A dart
with the Death Corps logo on it's flights in buried in the pictures forehead.
There is also some type of platform in the center of the room.

Drakoth's Office~
Your boots step loudly on the hardwood floors as you enter this rather poorly
lit room.  A large crossbow leans on one side of the huge oak desk.  A trail
of dried mud leads from the door around the desk.  Two empty mounts for what
could be lareg curved blades hang on the wall Drakoth must be out once
again, exploring new lands, searching for adventure and glory to be shared
by only the bravest of Medievia's citizens.
As you move further in the room a deep growl resonates from your right where
you turn to see a huge black wolf in front of the fireplace sit up to watch
your entry.

Tower of Terror~
The afternoon sun peeks through the scattered clouds just barely enough to keep
you warm in the cooling southwesterly breeze.  The palm trees sway in the wind
and you hear the sound of a lone coconut fall to the ground with a thump.  Your
feet tickle as the soft sand trickles between your toes.  With beach towels
laid out and your new bathing suit on, you are here to relax your muscles and
get away from the hazardous life of Medievia.  The butler stands outside the
beachhouse in full attire at attention with a tray of tropical drinks and
delicious foods.  Perhaps you should visit here more often?...

THE LAWS for GODS, read this often~
The Following are laws set by Vryce for all players above level 30.  These
laws are not to be taken as suggestions.  They are not open for
interpretation.  Right or wrong, they are the laws.  When in doubt of a
particular law, talk to Vryce.
Note:  In Medievia, just like in business, when you make it to the Top, and
you mess up, there is no punishment, no demotion, you are fired.  Once
Vryce purges you, you are free to start a new player at level 1.

THE LAWS for GODS,  - LEVELING~
Once you reach level 31, there is only ONE way to level.  Vryce advances
you to do a certain Job.  Any player level 32+ will need to do some basic
work making Medievia better.  Level 32 players are required to show up
regularly, at least weekly.  Level 33 are required to be a MAINSTAY on
Medievia, to show up often and work.  Level 34 players will only be made
to fullfill a very Important Job.  Level 35 players are required to
pretty much Devote themselves to Medievia.
JOBS: All players level 32+ will be given a Job, a task to do by Vryce.
They will be required to work to keep their level status.  Once one job
is done, another will be given.  We tailor GODHOOD to be a blast, lotsa
fun, but make no bones about it, there is work to be done.

THE LAWS for GODS,  - REIMBURSEMENTS~
ALL level 33 and 34 gods are required to do their share of re-imbursing.
If Vryce sees you becoming wiz-invis'd and hiding from mortals regularly,
you will be removed.  Reimbursing is something that takes common sense.
Do not be fooled into giving away the store.  Keep your fairness about
reimbursing players equally.  Vryce does not require you to "LIKE or
APPROVE" of the mortal to reimburse.  Look at the players level, know
how often the player has been here, ask the player, where did you get that
item?..  Generally we reimburse totally, except things that can be bought
in a store.  The player is required to KNOW exactly what is needed and
the whole reimbursement should take no longer than 5 minutes.  If the
same player is constantly needing reimbursing, ask questions to see if
perhaps there is a bug.  If not, the player is to be blacklisted from
reimbursing until the player can be reasonable and truthfull.

THE LAWS for GODS,  - WHAT NOT TO DO~
The fastest way to have Vryce remove you is to break some of the
following common sense laws.
SNOOPING, SWITCHING, or being INVIS to undermine a player's PRIVACY: There
is ONE, O N E reason to do this.  If you think the player is using a bug
to better their character.  Although Medievia does have a clause saying
all messages, actions, tells, and all goings on in Medievia are open to
the public and not secure in any way, we do TRY.  All GOD commands are
logged and checked weekly.  You will not get away with invading a player's
privacy. If you need to snoop on a player, see Vryce FIRST.  Vryce will
see the log and purge you without warning if you do not do so.

THE LAWS for GODS,  - WHAT NOT TO DO~
SETTING STATS ON PLAYERS AND MOBS:  When you need to set a stat on a
player, make sure you send a letter to Vryce explaining what was done
and why you did it.  No exeptions, if Vryce sees this in a log without
a letter, you will be purged.
When setting stats on mobiles, for quest purposes or just to be stir things
up, be reasonable.  Your job is to help the mortals have FUN.  Vryce will
not tolerate abusive in this form, even if it was a mistake.

THE LAWS for GODS,  - MEETINGS~
A GOD meeting will be held every thursday at 9pm eastern time.  This is
not set in stone, you will receive a letter detailing any changes.
ALL level 32+ Gods are REQUIRED to be a mainstay at these meetings.  They
are short and are kept focused by Vryce, he has been known to Freeze any
god that starts clowning around or talks out of turn.  The purpose of the
meetings vary greatly, just sit, listen and please THINK before you speak.
Any questions about God Meetings, mail Vryce.

THE LAWS for GODS,  - Vryce's hours~
The pressure for Vryce to be everywhere and be there for everyone has
caused a lot of friction in the past.  Vryce has gotten burnt out on more
than one occasion trying to keep everyone happy.  Please understand that
Vryce does not "want" to ignore you or to appear reclusive.
During the time between 8pm and 8:30pm, Vryce will be available for all
players level 31+ in his office upstairs.  Please think before you take
up valuable time, make sure you need his response before appearing
and be prepared to stay focused on your problem.
During any other time, if you need Vryce, tell to him ONCE.  If he does not
respond, he is either taking a well deserved break from MUDTALK or he is
AFK on another system coding.  If he is invisible, please do NOT tell to
him, this is a clear sign that he is editing something or is having an
important conversation with another god and wants to give his full
attention to that.

A Woodland Cottage~
This immense room, decorated in deep browns and lively greens, appears to have
been formed from a clearing in Mythago Wood.  Even the soft floor resembles a
carpet of moss, bright emerald.  The large wooden beams that support the walls
and ceilings of this dwelling are made from living oak trees.  Their colorful
leaves, dyed by the autumn sun's rays can be seen peering behind portraits of
Fast and Christie.  On the far wall, a sturdy stone fireplace blazes
brilliantly from within.  The flames crackling bright, illuminates the room
comfortably.  Heavy bear skin rugs, wolf and changewolf pelts, and gryphon
skins that hang from the walls and cover the floors leisurely add to this
snug dwelling.  Even Fast's tall, highbacked chair invites you to prop your
feet up and rest your tired bones.  You could stay here forever in such warm
surroundings.  A finely polished and intricately sharpened Skif's Dirk
reminds you quickly to who's house this belongs.  Sure hope you were invited.

You sense the extreme silence as you enter the study where Christie does her
work. The walls are painted a jade color, with many pictures of her family
hanging on the walls. The room is decorated with black furniture scattered
throughout. Near the corner, a desk holind a typewriter and a baby monitor
stands. So that Christie can listen to make sure that Fast is taking proper
care of her children.

 As you enter the library, you notice the numerous shelves of books that line
the walls. Their entertainment center is located within these shelves, and
contains thier big screen TV and VCR. The TV only seems to get three channels-
CNN, Mtv, and Nickelodeon. You also notice their complete stereo system and
right beside it is Fast's endless collection of Compact Disks. There seems to
be a complete collection of videos, but only on catches your eye- A Charlie
Brown Christmas. The room looks inviting so come in and make yourself at home.

Reception Area - Offices of the Superiors - 5th Floor~
You are standing in a room so large your vision cannot reach the far walls.
Although much of the room is a blank slate, you can see spots and traces
of life...the work of the busy Creators who's offices are found here.
Almost everything is half-done, but from what you see the finished product
will be spectacular beyond your greatest imagination.  The genius of the
Gods' and their creative abilities cannot cease to amaze you as you marvel
at a small scale representation of the ever expanding vast area that makes
up the world...of Medievia.  You see the massive model increasing in size
very slowly, before your very eyes, the Gods of Creation never rest.

info information~
>What is a gohome?
   A gohome is the ability to recall to a room in town. You can
   then quit from that room and it will save your stuff for free.
   Once you purchace a gohome, it will stay with your character,
   a gohome is not refundable or transferable to another
   character, once you have it, you have it. It will only work
   in the town where you have it, not accross the ocean or from
   one zone to another.
>Where can I get a gohome to?
   You can get a gohome to the your clanhall or house that you
   have permision to live in. You must be a member of the clan
   to gohome to the clanhall.
>How do I get a gohome?
   Talk or write to Lena. Make sure you have a bar of Adamantite
   and are in the room where you want to gohome to before you ask
   him.
>Can I get a objects or monsters, like fountains and guards to
  load into my house or clanhall every reset?
   No, at this point you cannot have this. It takes up too much
   memory for everyone to have. I don't think you would want
   us to lower the player limit to 50.
>How do I get my room description, look at descriptions, or enter/
  exit text changed or added?
   Talk to Lena. You can get a room description in your house
   or clanhall changed at any time for free. You can get a look
   at description where you type look statue, and it gives a
   description that you want to see for free. You can get text
   to appear when you enter or exit a room other than the
   standard for free, just talk to me.

Tress's Bedroom~
As you walk in the first thing you see is a wall filled with
weapons.  There are weapons of every size and shape hanging here,
with love and care, most of them cruel and deadly.  The room is
lit by multicolored candles that cast eerie shadows.  You see
"Pink Floyd The Wall", "Rocky Horror Picture Show", "Jimi Hendrix"
and "Type O Negative" posters hanging on a far wall.  Beautiful
roses and exotic orchids adorn the room.   In the middle of the

The Medievia Book Shoppe~
You stand in a small quaint bookstore. All the walls are covered by old
dusty bookshelves filled with ancient tomes of priceless value. There is
a small sofa in the center of the room and a small reading table next to it.
The room is quite dim, there are only a few candles lighting the whole area.
You see some people sitting on the sofa with their coffee reading some of the
many books here. The store clerk is sitting by a small desk watching you
so you don't steal anything.
Item : Note on the counter.

A huge bookcase towers over you, inviting you to explore. The bookcase seems
to be very old and someone has taken the time to carve elaborate dragon heads
on either side, each frozen with a strange terrified expression. The books seem
old too, some covered with a think layer of dust that obscures any trace of
titles.

A small bridge~
A small wooden bridge spans over the river Courrain. This newly built bridge
seems to be slightly worn out. Wagon tracks, and scratches line the bridge
giving it an antique look.  The river underfoot flows out of a tunnel to the
north, then turns and enters another dark murky passage to the east.

Baryon's Tevatron~
You stand in an odd shaped room; its toroid with a circular cross section.
A panel has been removed from the wall of the room exposing a large
superconducting magnet which is cracked.  Good thing because standing here
with beams of protons and anti-protons screaming down the toroidal path
doesn't seem like a pleasant experience.  There is a chair, tool box, and
cooler next to the open panel.  The cooler contains Lynchberg Lemonade and
Liquid Nitrogen; now that's and odd combination.  Baryon is just really wierd!

The Barracks~
This is a rather large, rectangular room; approximately 30 feet from
east to west and almost 100 feet from north to south.  Cots, bedrolls,
and sleeping bags fill just about the entire area, making it very
difficult to move.  Clothes, armor, weapons, and various other items
are scattered about.  A wooden ladder leans against the wall in the
north-east corner.  A trap door is set in the ceiling just above the
ladder, allowing passage to ground level.  The walls are covered with
huge pieces of fabric, covering the cold, bare stone.

ocean. The mountains of Trellor outline the small bay to the east.
There is a fireplace made of stone.  Above the fireplace hangs a painting
of a tall, handsome warrior.  The corner of your eye catches the sparkle
from a crystal vase that rests on the mantle, filled with beautiful
fragrant roses of the deepest blue.  A narrow wooden staircase on the right
leads up to a room that seems aglow with moonlight.

The Crusader's Chambers~
You have entered the sacred chambers of the Crusaders.  Looking about you
notice that not only is the room enormous but its also round. Sitting in the
center of the room is a huge round table, and upon closer inspection you see
that there is a map etched into its surface, assumedly of the catacombs.
Looking up you see the ceiling is covered in the most beautiful yet horrifying
scenes of battles, probably from past crusades. The walls are encircled with
shelves full of all kinds of intriguing objects. On some shelves you see books
on how to defeat and or tame every beast known and some unknown, on others
there are charms, roots and other strange mystical items that you can only
assume aid the Crusaders in their quest to rid the world of evil. Regardless
of all the oddities of the room you instantly feel at ease here in this room.

Within these extensive worm holes, a niche has been carved in the rock. This
is Levork's home, a comfortable, albeit dark, room. Scattered around the
floor are weapons and green potions, while a large bed and elegant furniture
dominate the scene. Along the gleaming stone walls are hung several trophies
of Levork's younger days. The light is provided by flickering candles mounted
in a golden candelabra which rests on the floor.
The only entrance is a hole in the wall to the south, blocked by a boulder.

The Hall Of The Guardian~
  Vertigo overwhelms you as the size of the room is incredibly large.
Pale marble statues of Guardian Heros line the sides of the entrance.  Crossing
their swords saluting those who enter these halls.  A merry fire that
crackles in the granite fireplace in front of you seems to call you to sit
down on the bearskin rug and relax.  An incredibly ornate and well crafted
chandelier hangs above you, bathing the entire room with its light.
To the east you see the Wall of Tears.  Upon it, the names of Guardians who
have made the ultimate sacrifice, who dedicated and gave their lives to Honor,
Truth, and Justice.  To the west, you see a grotesque sight.  Thousands of
mummified heads that belonged to the ruffians that the Guardians vanquished
line the walls.  Though the Guardians are benevolent in nature.  They have
learned how to depart your head from your body quite swiftly.  To the
south, large glass windows allow you to see the magnificence of the Great
Tree, and the towering mountains that lie behind it.
A Plaque hangs over the fire, with the One word......."Endure".

violence, and death radiates from within.  Old novels, old scriptures from
creatures long deceased dill the walls.  In the center of the room lies a

Assistants to Vryce~
Vryce has two assistants, Io and Shalafi. Vryce, Io and Shalafi keep eachother
constantly informed in the general management of Medievia and its
spinoffs. The job of managing Medievia has become a monster. Vryce
generally gets more mail and tells then any sane person can handle.
So, what happens is all of Vryce's mail (mud and email) go to Io
and Shalafi. When you TELL to Vryce, if also goes to Io and Shalafi if they
are logged in and on duty. Make no bones about this following
statement as Vryce will not tollerate any interpretation of it.
Io and Shalafi speak for Vryce, what they tell you IS to be taken very
seriously. They will keep track of what gods are doing, they will
filter Vryce's mail and tells and take care of any of it that Does not
need his immediate attention. Vryce has delegated COMPLETE
authority to Io and Shalafi. They are now the ambassadors of Medievia
and share Vryce's managing duties.

The Arctic Tundra - Pug's Homeland~
This is the vast frozen land of Pug's origins. The days and nights here each
last about six months, so it takes some getting used to. In the distance to
the west it is flat for as far as the eye can see. To the east and north-
east are mountains. The sun seems to be glinting off of something on one of
the higher peaks.
    There is a path leading to the mountains.

As soon as you enter this room you are filled with both fear and awe. Your
sixth sense tells you to leave, yet you are compelled to stay. You look
around. Oaken chairs and tables are scattered throughout the room. Daggers,
guantlets, and shields litter the room. There is a large picture on the north
wall, directly above the blazing fireplace. The picture shows the fearless
clan leader, Enforcer, taking out a gryphon with a double backstab. You get
a lump in your throat and aren' sure how much longer you want to stay in this
den of death.

Clan Hall-The Round Table~
You see before you a rather large room. A huge table made of some glowing
material fills the center of it.  There are twenty chairs lined up around
the table with names of clan members engraved with perfection. The walls
also glow with a light you can just barely see. There are various trophies
lined up around the various shelves.  You feel at home here.  It's very quiet.
Very thick walls surround you.  Through magic you arrived here in this
magic room, and through magic you shall leave.  Type EXITS to see your
possible destinations.

Lair of the Worm~
You have descended into a dark, musty subterranean passage. Clods
of cold, wet earth fall down on your head from the roughly hewn
ceiling. There seems to be tunnels leading to the east and to the
west. A few feet ahead of you, you think you can discern the rough
edges of a pit going downwards.

This office is furnished in a grand style, with a mahogany desk and cradenza.
The bookcase along the west wall contains Firm's memoirs of his adventures
during his mortal existence.  The desk is neat and bare with little more to be
found on it than a pad of paper, an ink well and a long gryphon quill.  The
`guest chairs are neatly arranged in such a fashion as to give his guests a nice
view of the city of Medievia below.

Hall of the Neue Regel ~
You step into the shadows of this large hall.  Strange music seems to be
coming out of the darkness.  Listening closely, you hear bits and pieces
of the lyrics, "... I will light the way for us to find - order of a new
kind - join us on the stay - the road is mine! ... I can hear the chimes -
ringing for you for me ... I can feel its time - come together hold the
light - keep the flame we can't let this world remain - the same! ... It's
time for the world to hear - Neue Regel is here!"  You pause a moment,
wondering what kind of changes the inhabitants of this hall must have in
mind for the world.  Your eyes shift to the center of the room focusing
on a small flame burning brightly beneath a crystal sphere.   Stepping,
closer, the images that fill your mind blend with those that are now
flickering in the crystal.   For one, shining, brief moment the world
seems to be in order.  You stretch out your hand to touch the sphere...
and it's gone.

The Observatory~
After a long climb thru the back stairs of the clanhall, you open a trapdoor to
find yourself at a chamber at the top of the roof.  The roof has an opening,
thru which a telescope is pointed toward the dark Medievia sky.  It has been
said that Huxley, when he led the Lords of Discipline, used to spend many hours
here, alonestaring into the constellations pondering their dim illumination
through the ebony void.  Though he fought long and hard to gain power and
fame, he wondered whether, like the stars, his battle was in vain.

Beyond the strange portal is a place of pure darkness, where any light seems

for going to such a place...yet, it feels strangely comforting...almost like
you are being wrapped in a warm blanket.  You somehow know that in this dark
place you are safe.

Beside Reality~
This seems to be an endless, dim place, with the only landmarks being the
scattered glowing rifts through which glimpses of the mortal world may be
seen.  Out of the corners of your eyes may be seen strange shapes, yet nothing
is visible when you turn to look directly.  Not only that, but the emptiness
seems to flash glimpses of other things when your attention wanders.
The strange energies of this place seem to enhance magical ability... perhaps
with concentration and training more than mere images could be conjured up?

Penthouse Level - Reception Area~
You are awestruck by the incredible majesty, size, and wonder of this room.
The ceiling is so far above you that it is simply a blur of gold, silver, and
magnificent artwork... 7 Diamond chandeliers, with ruby, sapphire and emerald
accents, worked in gold and silver, hang from chains of fine silver, like a
spider's web, impossibly thin and delicate, from the far off ceiling.
The floor is a marble design which you would never have believed possible, a
pure white color with exotic swirls of subtle colors run through it. In
various places throughout the room are some lovely rugs of the finest
materials and designs. On the far off walls, paintings only the gods
themselves could have created hang. In the center of the room stands a huge
black oblisk, which occasionally pulsates with a dim color. There is no
reception desk, to the three directions spanning the distance are 3 great
doorways, worked of fine hardwoods, precious metals, with gems and jewels
worked in the metal and wood. On each of the doors is a gold plaque, with
words engraved in pure holy light.
Exits: North, South, East, West - You can look at the doors. (LOOK DOORS)

Office of Io, Goddess of Core Dumps~
This place isn't quite chaotic, but it sure is messy.  Io has two desks
and both are piled high with stuff.  There can't be a square inch of
clean space between them.  Despite the seemingly random stacks of papers,
manuals, magazines, hardware, and toys, the room is actually quite cozy.
On the walls are several posters, post cards and conference badges.  On
the monitor, sits an amazingly lifelike plastic monitor lizard. On a
chalkboard are written the rules for reimbursement.

chalkboard board rules reimbursement sign~
Players are only reimbursed for items lost due to a gaming problem.
Follow the directions carefully if you want your items back.  If
there is a fountain, drink from it when you get hungry to minimize
spam.
1) No items you can buy in town, including food, waterskins,
   bags, backpacks, potions, recall scrolls, etc...
2) No gold, including bars.
3) No Dragon Crystals.
4) No items you didn't have before. You will be purged for lying.
5) Give the SPECIFIC name of each item.
6) Name each item one at a time. State it's name, then WAIT
   until that item is loaded before you go on to the next item.
Always list items one at a time.  List them in descending order of
importance in case the reimbursement ends. Don't ask for items you
can easily replace yourself. Follow these simple rules and we can
be done quickly.

You are in a massive stairwell, leading up and down. It is nearly fourty
feet square, rising up hundreds of feet into darkness. Carved stone
steps protrude from the wall, spiralling upwards. Strange orbs,
a foot in diameter, float in the center of the shaft. Each one
ten feet above the last. They glow with a soft, flickering light.
An archway, trimmed with intricate silver designs, leads north.

Painting~
     In this painting you see colorful sprites.. playful pixies.. happy
smiley bunnies.. all playing in carefree bliss. Yet something is wrong..
out of place.. you examine more closely.. There is blood dripping from a
thousand wounds on each of the sprites.. the pixies are mangled hopelessly..
the bunnies are missing their ears.. and then you notice something to make you shiver in terror
The smiles have faded. Each one of the playful happy animals are screaming
in terror! you notice movement.. My god! they are alive! And enduring this
torment?? Gothic has trapped them in this painting.. They are hopelessly
trapped in neverending torture for eternity.

You are standing at the edge of a small cliff, about 20 feet above a small
private beach below. Sand dunes, accented by small plants sporatically,
rise up to the east and west, secluding this area. Stairs have been carved
into the front of the rock face leading down to the beach. Set back from
the edge a little is a natural, in ground pool, filled with water and
sparkling in the sunlight. A sandy path curves through the dunes to the north.

 The love shack is a big old place where Tina and Stu can get together. It is a
rather large room covered with the finest of paintings and decorations. Flowers
surround the room and you can sense the "woman's touch" that has transformed
this former Playboy mansion into the cozy home it is now. On the left portion
of this bedroom you notice our pool-sized jacuzzi and matching hot tub. Look
right and see king size waterbed with a draped canopy and candles surrounding
it. This is where Medievia's favorite couple goes to relax after a hard day of
battle. Please take your shoes off and feel comfortable. YOUR COMPANY IS MORE
THAN WELCOMED HERE! In case the mud Enquirer is here please know that Tina and
Stu are not just mud-loves. They take their romance to their real life and are
madly in love. If you are enemy to Scum or Tina: ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK ! You
remark a large WINDOW that you want to LOOK at.

Liselle's Lair~
    This is the lair of Liselle, Leader of the Shadow Wolves. She uses it
to rest, meditate or have private meetings with members of her clan. The
furnishings in the room are comfortable and practical. A leather covered sofa
and matching easy chair are arranged around a central fireplace. The fireplace
keeps the room warm and allows guests to cook their meat if they so choose.
Furs of various meat-bearing beasts adorn the floors (probably taken from pack
kills). An oak desk is in the corner and is fairly clear of clan paperwork at
the moment.
    It is only now that you notice the pale golden eyes of a large timber
wolf gazing speculatively at you from around the edge of the fireplace...

Heaven in Hell~
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
You have entered Heaven 'n Hell, the asylum of Asskicker. The walls
are covered with playboy centerfolds and a giant mirror hovers above
a huge heart-shaped bed dressed in red satin sheets. There is a  warm
and inviting fire blazing in the fireplace facing the bed.  A remote
control sits on the table next to the bed.  It is obviously used
for the many electronic gadgets you see around the room.  You smile
as you spot a sheer red robe with a monogrammed S on it and wonder who
it could belong to.
::
On the mantle are several pictures of Asskicker with various friends
family and clan members. On close inspection, you can see that he is indeed
a very attractive, yet intelligent man.  As you walk further into
this abode of Sin, you are startled as suddenly he appears before you...

MUDSlinger Press~
There is a tremendous din from the massive off-set press that dominates the
center of this room. Along the far walls huge rolls of newsprint await the
transformation into pages of The Medievia MUDSlinger. As you wander around
the room, you see Pug in a printer's apron shouting orders to the printers,
who scurry to keep the press running. Somehow, Pug manages to hear you coming
over all the noise and turns your way. He looks at you and says, "If you don't
have a submission for the paper...SCOOT! I am too busy...Hmm? Oh. You DO have
a submission? Great! Give it to one of the copy-boys. COPY!!!"
  A young man in ink-stained coveralls runs over to Pug and says, "Yessir?".

press offset ~
   This offset press is a mechanical marvel. It also makes a helluva racket!
As rolls of newsprint are fed into the press, large print-plates move across
the freshly cut sheets and print whole pages at a time. The constant ku-chunk,
ku-chunk, ku-chunk of the printing is followed by loud swish swish swishings
of the pages to the sorter. This is followed by click-slap of the paper folder
in action. This thing is quite a sight to watch!

FIB, Sanctuary Of The FIBERS~
This is the origin of all FIBERS' power.
In the front wall you can see the word QUARTZ written above some strange boxes
called NEFTIS, OSIRIS, ISIS and EFIB01. In the eastern wall there are some
other boxes: AKRON, AMOTO, ALABI and ALABA. BACO, EOLO and ICARO are in the
western wall. If I were you I'd leave before VicH arrives.

Order of Light Holy Temple~
 This is the Order of Light Temple. To your left and right tall columns of
white marble support the ceiling some hundred feet above. Right in front of
you, to the south, a beautiful stained glass window depicts a Holy Knight of
the Order slaying some demons. The silence is impressive, and an aura of
holiness pervades all. To the east, in the shadows, a small corridor leads to
the confessional.

The confessional~
 Here you can think back about your past sins and misdeeds and pray for

furnished with an unconfortable seat for the sinner and with a cosy leather
armchair for the priest. On the south wall hangs a tapestry showing sinners
suffering a terrible agony in the flames of Hell.

The Hall of the Knights Templar~
You step cautiously between the watchful eyes of two armed knights, and
enter the splendid hall which stands before you. Its interior is lit by the
flickering glow of countless candles, letting the ceiling fade into darkness
above. All around you are scenes from the Templars' epic battles against the
infidels, and there is a large red cross on the far wall. To the right of it
is a portrait of Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master of the Templars, while on
the left is a portrait of the clan' local leader. A group of Monks walk
silently about a large exotic carpet which covers the floor, and a solemn
knight advances towards you, bows, and greets you with a welcome smile.

A Secret Tunnel~
The walls here have an unnatural glow, filling the area with a dream like
wavering blue light.  Engraved into the wall is a detailed image of a woman
dancing in a forest, with a man watching her, sitting
by a tree.  Gathered all around are animals, all watching this strange
woman dance.

You are walking along a lovely path that twists and winds its way through

flowers adorn the surroundings, exciting your senses. Mounds of earth and
large rocks have been placed about to better display the foliage.
A large wooden gate to the south provides entrance to the City's stables.

Hall Of Shadows~
Here is where The Shadow Wolves come to gather, for banquets, celebrations, or
war conferences. A huge open fireplace encompasses the far wall. Above it
hangs a large portrait of the clan ancestors. Filling the center of the room is
a large oaken table worn with decades of use. Around the table stand an
assortment of chairs, obviously personalized for those who use them. Behind the
chairs are various family portraits and maps of Medievia and its surrounding
lands covering the wall. The wonderful aroma of meats roasting almost
overcomes your fear of approaching the two large lupine forms curled up
in front of the fire.

Lumpi's Dungeon~
You feel immediately that you have just made a terrible mistake by
entering this room without being invited.  Shattered items cover the floor,
most of them very close to the trapdoor and the daggers that are sticking in
the wall next to it make you feel really uncomfortable.  Knowing Lumpi's
bad temper you start to pity the poor individuals that tried to talk
reasonably with her in this room.  Seeing bloodstains on the carpet you
cannot help the thought of how many poor fools didn't make it out in time.
As you meet Lumpi's glare you are reminded of a mad She-Dragon and you know
you would have preferred to have encountered a real Dragon here instead of
finding Lumpi in this mood.  Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to think of
a final prayer and hope you can run faster than she throws her daggers.

Penthouse Level - Reception Area~
You are awestruck by the incredible majesty, size, and wonder of this room.
The ceiling is so far above you that it is simply a blur of gold, silver, and
magnificent artwork... 7 Diamond chandeliers, with ruby, sapphire and emerald
accents, worked in gold and silver, hang from chains of fine silver, like a
spider's web, impossibly thin and delicate, from the far off ceiling.
The floor is a marble design which you would never have believed possible, a
pure white color with exotic swirls of subtle colors run through it. In
various places throughout the room are some lovely rugs of the finest
materials and designs. On the far off walls, paintings only the gods
themselves could have created hang. In the center of the room stands a huge
black oblisk, which occasionally pulsates with a dim color. There is no
reception desk, to the three directions spanning the distance are 3 great
doorways, worked of fine hardwoods, precious metals, with gems and jewels
worked in the metal and wood. On each of the doors is a gold plaque, with
words engraved in pure holy light.
Exits: North, South, East, West - You can look at the doors. (LOOK DOORS)

The Courtroom~
This is a large courtroom. In the northern portion of the room
are a series of chairs, so that the public may observe court
proceedings. The room is split down the center in front of these
chairs by a bar, with a swinging gate in its middle. Beyond the
bar, in the southern portion of the room, are two tables and two
chairs behind each table. One is marked with a PIE sign, the other
with a DELTA sign. Against the eastern wall is a box-in section
with 12 uncomfortable-looking chairs in it, the jury box.
Against the southern wall is the judges bench, with a plush
chair behind it, and a gavel atop it. To the west of the bench
is another, smaller bench, for the clerk of the court.
A baliff is here, to protect the integrity of the court.
There is a sign against one wall, and a plaque against another.

A small bridge~
 A small wooden bridge spans over the river Courrain. This newly built bridge
seems to be slightly worn out. Wagon tracks, and scratches line the bridge
giving it an antique look. The river underfoot flows from the town square to
the north and enters a dark stone tunnel to the south.

A townhouse on the east side~
Stepping inside, your feet are met by a cool, hard, marble flooring.  It's a
black marble with emerald green veins.  Matching pillars of the same marble
stand tall, like giant oak trees, amidst the circular foyer.  A large staircase
winds up the righthand side of the room, leading upstairs to Vehn's office.  To
the north is an arched doorway leading to the living room.

The Master's Bedroom~
You magically appear in a warm room that has been magically honed from
the rock deep down in the earth.  A waterbed occupies the east wall with
a beautifully carved headboard of rare woods inlaid with shimmering
and two stands of marble next to the bed hold several vials of oil and
various lotions.  You notice the leather restraints attached to each
of the four corners of the bed. Above the bed, almost like a canopy,
is a padded board with shackles. Suspended if by magic, the board
can be turned to any angle, 360 degrees. A large red feather rests upon the
coverlet in the center of the bed awaiting a victim to tickle.

jacuzzi is enough to ward of the chill.  Hopefully the mists will be
enough to provide privacy to anyone in the jacuzzi from the few taller
buildings nearby.

-=Parlor of Perversion=-~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you enter this wonderful haven of sexual deviance, your senses
are aroused by the scent of erotic incense snd soft red luminous candles.
In the center of the room is a large four-posted, mirrored canopy waterbed.
It has no sheets and is coated in scented oils.
..
Attached to the posts are fur-linedleather restraints.  A leather flogging
whip hangs from the headboard, along with a set of black pearl anal beads
with mithril thread. Along the walls are various candle holders and chests
with *fun*  toys over-flowing.
..
Hypnotic instrumental music flows enticingly to your ears.  The mood
is set and you feel a stirring in your loins.

The Cheese Emporium~
As you enter this strange place, you almost trip over a stray wedge of
cheese.  You look around and see a magnificent ballroom encompassing
you, its walls draped in dark velvet and its black marble floors
glowing with power.  It's quite dim and not much surrounds you, but
you can feel the spirits that inhabit this genesis of supremacy.
Directly in front of you, a huge spiral staircase winds its way
upwards, leading to a floor five flights into the sky.  You hear
the bass sounds of a stereo and the cracking of billiards balls
upstairs.  Scratching your head, you become curious of what exactly
is up there (and where that damn smell of cheese is coming from).

This building seems much larger on the inside than the outside, with plenty
of room for anyone who wishes to enter. The far walls do seem to be a bit
indistinct, growing fuzzy with distance. There is a roof over your head,

There do not seem to be many kitties about... except for that Mist Lynx

The Waiting Room~
Black granite walls, modeled after the casting chamber in Trellor this
room definitely has some underlying evil built into its foundations. The
sandstone used in the creation of the floor was supposedly stolen from
The valley of kings, in Giza, Egypt on earth thousands upon thousands of
years ago. The granite on the walls was also supposedly chipped off the
Temple Of Bloodstone when it was being constructed. On the main table you
see many jars with preserved Lamia heads, Metagolem toes, and Mephit
fingers. In the corner is a huge menacing crow in a cage, with a label
hanging from its black iron bars titled: Flagg. On the ceiling are
strange scrawlings possibly of incantations and rites of Necro's deadly
troops, The Soldiers of the Shadow of Death. All along the west wall is
engraved Psalm 23 in huge red glowing letters.

******************* CHAMPIONS belts are in !  ************************
These Magnificant Belts are reserved for the TRUE Champions of Medievia!
Only the BEST of the BEST can wear em!  Do you have what it takes to
be a Champion?  Are you made of the right stuff?  Does your Demonfire or
Backstab TRULY HURT!  Well, nows your chance to PROVE it!
There are FOUR belts in the Game!  One for EACH class!
60 mana and 10 damroll for the Demonfire and Fireball addicts
60 hits and 10 damroll for the Bashers and BSers
Ac 30 for all.
How? who? when ? where ? what ? gasp !
How is the champion determined in EACH CLASS?
=============================================
1) The champion is the player who takes the shortest time to accomplish
a well standardized performance.  (i.e. Kill some Mobs)
2) The champion owns the champion's belt until his record is beaten by
another player of the same class.
3) In this case the corresponding belt is loaded and given to the new champion
as well as some other rewards. (see further)
4) The old champion is transferred and must relieve his belt, or, if he's not
currently playing he will be MudMailed and must mail the belt to one of the
gods.
What is the contest ?
=====================
A small zone of 13 rooms has been created, called the Champs Grounds.
This zone is not accessible to players, you must be 'Transfered' there.
Mobs from all over Medievia will be loaded into the Zone.  Your job is to
kill the MOBS in the shortest amount of time.
The central room is a safe place where the player can safely recover,
and is fast mana regen.
The mobs are :
Gith, Shool, One chess King, One chess Queen, Amos, The Beholder
Mars, King Croco
and some others.. SURPRISE !
but no Striders..

The Wolves' Den~
You have entered the library and hangout of Danae and Mousse.  A very
relaxed atmosphere welcomes you, shelves of tattered, worn books line the
walls, hovering over the doors, and a clean but well-used coffee machine
stands against the west wall.  A small mahogany table sits in the soutwest
corner, adorned with a dark cloth, an assortment of mugs and a magazine
titled 'How to survive the Playground in five simple steps.'  Mousse's
Shelter lies to the south, Danae's loft to the north, and you feel a shiver
run down your spine as you look up.

The Wolves' Playground~
Forlorn granite walls enclose you and your skin is chilled by the sharp drop
in temperature. This is where the Wolves come to play when all the mobs have
gone away. When you entered you thought it was dark, but through the skylight
 -- the playground's only window -- shines the lurid glow of the full moon.
This light is the great inspiration of the Shadow Wolves.
   As you peruse the exits, you hear the not-so-distant howl of a wolf pack on
the hunt. Perhaps now would be the perfect time to execute, if not a full
retreat, at least a tactical withdrawal.

Beginning of a jetty~
You are walking along a beautiful white sandy beach. The crystal clear
water of the ocean washes up on shore in a neverending cycle. The are many
large rocks in the sand here and they form a line out into the ocean.
Cliffs rise up out of the sand to the north and west, blocking your way in
those directions.  Stairs have been carved out of the rock face to the north,
leading up.

moss on the wet rocks, you become hypnotized by the water swirling inbetween
the stones.

sea breeze blow through your hair.

down on you and warm water massages your feet.

The living room~
Though a large and spacious room, its natural appeal and informal decor gives
it an air of warmth and coziness that overwhelms you, making you feel at home.
In the center of the room lies a lengthy sandy-brown sectional sofa which
welcomes you to be cradled by its fuzzy, warm upholstery and fluffy cushions.
At each end of the sofa are solid oak endtables and tall brass lamps.  In
the back of the room are large glass windows leading out to the deck.  The
light from the sun streams through the glass with a soft radiance that
fills the room.  To the left is the kitchen which is separated from this room
by a counter which is used as a small bar.  Four padded stools lie in front of
it.  On the back wall, next to the counter, is a neon Budweiser sign to add
some personality.  Turning to your right, you glance at a high-tech entertain-
ment system.  After studying all the gadgetry for a moment or two, you find
yourself plopping on the couch and flipping the channels.

Upon entering, you first notice the large oaken desk in the center of the room.
It's fine workmanship and beauty convey a feeling of importance, as does the
large, black leather executive's chair behind it.  It has a high back and can
swivel and tilt back if the occupant desires.  Upon the broad desk are neat
stacks of paper.  Some of them are scribbles and notes, others are reports and
documents, while others are doodles and pictures done in ASCII characters.
Beside the papers sets a computer and coffee mug full of pencils and papers.
At the front of the desk is a name plate that lets you know that this is Vehn's
office.

The master bedroom~
You are left breathless by the the shear beauty and visual warmth of this room.
A large brass bed lies against the west wall of the room.  It is clothed in
cream-colored satin sheets and covered by a soft, thick comforter.  The bed has
been left unmade, the sheets pulled back, almost welcoming you to slip inside.
To your right are large windows which, in the morning, allow the eastern sun to
shine its loving rays down upon Vehn, gently arousing him from his peaceful
slumber.  On each side of the bed are matching, cream-colored bedlamps.  A
cordless phone lies next to one of them with its antenna half pulled out.  The
entire room is carpeted with thick, luxurious carpeting.  Looking again to your
right, against the south wall, is a tall oak dresser.  To your left is a
similar oak dresser and vanity.  Near the back of the room is the doorway to
the shower.  Directly ahead are french doors which lead out onto the balcony.
From there, you can gaze down upon the garden.

Vehn's private art gallery~
The beautifully elegant style of the foyer is continued here in the gallery.
The thick, marble pillars support a walkway on the next floor which encircles
this entire room.  Looking up, you notice a high cathedral ceiling upon which
are paintings of gods and mortals alike.  Upon the heavenly white walls hang
various masterpieces by some of the more famous artists that Vehn admires.
There are soft benches with red, plush padding to ensure endless hours of
appreciating the magnificant artistry which you are so priveleged to behold.
You may look at the following pieces of art: Air Jordan poster, an eye, DNA,
a skull and crossbones, Marilyn Monroe, John F. Kennedy, and Babe Ruth.

The kitchen~
The room glows with a bright, white aura that' almost blinding. After a few
seconds, your vision improves and you make out a typical modern kitchen where
all appliances, the flooring, and the walls are clean and white. Among the
appliances include a double- refridgerator, a Cappucino machine, a microwave
oven, and a dishwasher. Stepping over to the sink and looking out the small,
drive- window that' just above it, you notice a cute little squirrel
nibbling on a walnut on the deck outside as he stares back at you. Suddenly,
a rush of clean, cool air runs across your face through the window. You squint
and then smile. You turn and make your way to the fridge and open it. Inside
is a cornicopia of food, all spread out in a colorful manor, very pleasing to
the eye. You are tempted and decide to pull out a plate of southern fried
chicken and sit at the table thinking what great food this is.

The Order of the Silver Crescent Clan Hall~
You find yourself standing in a large, well-lit hall belonging to the
Crescent -- or so you deduce by the large, hammered silver crescent hanging
over the enormous fireplace at the end of the room. The rest of the interior
is quite tastefully appointed with many fur rugs, finely-woven tapestries,
and a large selection of comfortable places to sit. You also notice a plaque
hanging above an engraved sign by the main entrance, as well as a variety of
other doors leading off the hall to the private rooms of the members of the
Order.

A steamy shower room~
A breathtaking jungle of exotic plants surrounds a warm waterfall.
Steam rises off the water as is cascades over smooth black rocks into a
comfortable pool.  Small benches sit just under the surface of the water, one
under the waterfall and one on the opposite end of the pool.  The room is
brightly lit by small luminescent plants mixed in with the lush vegitation.

As you descend a flight of cloud like steps you notice an immediate change
in temperature and humidity. You glance around the room and see magnums of fine
vintage wine stacked on racks throughout the cave. Majestic purple tapestries
cover the walls to give this cave a regal appearance.  A large table sits in
the middle of this room covered with a white linen tablecloth.  Two rows
of fine crystal goblets line the table and await you.

The Hemp Grove~
This is a huge hemp grove. The plants are 10 feet high, and have all
gone to seed. You cannot see to the other side of the field, because
of the thick plants. The air smells fresh here, like it just rained.
The ground is moist under your toes, and the warm sun shines down on
your face. You can see workers harvesting the plant, they all seem
to be so happy, you wonder why. You grab a basket and decide to pick
some of this stuff and see what is so good about it. A few hours
later, you forget you were even at the grove.

Carved into the floor of this room, filling it from edge to edge is a
complex pattern of circles and channels, though which endlessly spirals
dozens of spheres that pulse in time with the huge ball of light that
hangs motionless above the very centre of the pattern and the crystaline
fountain that sprays a gentle mist into the air, binding the minds of the
clan in communion and holding open the portal to medievia

The Beginning of a small moutain path~
 You arrived at the basis of the zodiac mountain, in front of you stands a path
borded by very deep ravines on both sides, even if it seems to be a very
dangerous path to walk on, you feel a sort of undefined attraction that forces
you to progress north. You pray to the gods and cross your fingers.

This is a room made only for reimbursing players for items
they lost due to a gaming problem. Follow the directions
carefully if you want your items back.
1) No items you can buy in town, including food, waterskins,
   bags, backpacks, potions, recall scrolls, etc...
2) No gold, including bars.
3) No Dragon Crystals.
4) No items you didn't have before. She will know if your
   lying, and will purge you for it.
5) Give the SPECIFIC name of each item.

Pipeline's private Tube~
This is the room were I can relax a bit. The room is a huge dark hall.
Many candles are brightning the hall a bit. It's a place of peace.
You hear a little background humming, there is something misterious here.
East from the hall you see a huge torture table, but strangly it isn't
frightning at all, it's part of the world you co-exist in when you spend
some time here. It's a perfect place to spend some time on your own.
The hall is just so magical, you need magic to get in, you need magic to
get out.

Stormchylde's Office~
The feeling of forboding that permeates this tower does not extend
to this office. The floors are bare of blood and skulls, instead covered with
a variety of different fur rugs. The walls are adorned not with weapons,
but with maps of Trellor and Medievia, pictures of friends and family.
There is a giant oak desk set against the far wall with many papers and
books strewn across it. To the north there is a fireplace that burns with
aromatic wood. There is a large chair behind the desk that looks infinitely
comfortable. The only weapon seen in this office is Stormchylde's whip, that
hangs from a hook behind the chair. In front of the desk there are two more
chairs that look somewhat comfortable to sit in.

[Stormchylde's Throne Room]~
Upon entering this room, you feel a heavy weight on your soul, as if
the souls of all the dead from all the wars of the past keen in your
ear. The floors are made of an indescribeable stone, covered with the
dried and cracked skulls of many different races. The walls are made
of the same stone and adorned with many exotic and esoteric weapons.
There is a path of sorts through the remains of the dead leading to
a obsidian throne, set upon a dais of skulls. It is flanked by 4
Shadow Wolves, chained to the dais by beams of black light.

This is the reception area to the MudSlinger Press.  A pretty secretary
greets you warmly and asks you what business you have with the newspaper.
To the east is the office of the current editor, Columnus.  To the north
and west are the offices of the former editors, Achad and Pug.  You
hear a faint rumbling, the press must be running.

 This spacious office has a large desk in its center and a large picture window
overlooking Medievia. On the deak sits a Power PC with a slide scanner and a
laser printer. A picture of the beautiful Ann in a heart shaped frame is also
on the desk. On one wall is a giant board with story assignments for the next
MudSlinger. The rest of the walls are covered with hockey artifacts.
Autographed pictures, sticks, pucks and jerseys adorn the other walls. A great

Jchaaden's Private Sanctum~
This is a large room lit dimly by eerie candles made of black wax. A king
sized bed sits against the far wall. It has high posts made of dragon bone
which forms a canopy over the bed. Small chests and dressers are placed about
the room which hold personal belongings, best left untouched. A fair sized
fireplace is built into one of the walls. An odd blue-green flame burns in
its depths, yet there is no wood or other visible fuel. You are over come by
an almost hypnotic peace.
