                  The great affair is to move."
                 "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."
                 "They must upward still, and onward who
                  would keep abreast of Truth."
                 "It is the secret sympathy,
                  The silver link, the silken tie,
                  Which heart to heart and mind to mind,
                  In body and in soul can bind."
                 "To wake the soul by tender strokes of art.
                  To raise the genius, and to mend the heart."

An odd place, to be sure. This must be the home of the man who takes care of
the clock tower, because it is obvious whoever lives here is obsessed with
time. Dozens of clocks of various shapes and sizes lie about here, Cukoo
clocks adorn the walls, and three rather impressive grandfather clocks stand
in the middle of each of the three walls to the south, east and west. Every
table in the house has a clock on it, if not more than one.

by evil sorcerers, and dragons, came to Tear, and overthrew the great Stone.
Whosoever should find the Stone again, should he be worthy, and powerful
enough, may find great knowledge and power within, along with what may be left
of the great treasures of Tear. He who seeks to exit, must know the secret
word to open the magically sealed door. The clues lie within.
