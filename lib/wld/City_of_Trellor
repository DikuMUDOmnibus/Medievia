Morg's Butcher Shop~
You step into a room smelling strongly of raw venison and duck,
more dimly lit than most shops. The only light here is provided
by the shining glints of approximately 150 cleavers hung on every
available space of the walls. Evidently Morg has a minor obsession.
You wisely conclude that your business here shall be prompt.

Guild of Shadows~
You gaze about in awe at the most magnificent thieves' and assassin's
guild you have ever seen.  The floor is covered with a thick, luxurious
black carpet, and upon the walls are hung murals and paintings of the
most exquisite design.  The lighting is very dim, and shadows seem to
leap out at you from every direction, but you almost feel...at home, or
at least you feel as comfortable as one in your profession will ever
feel. An especially large mural upon the western wall catches your eye:
it is of strikingly beautiful woman dressed only in an ebony cloak,
pressing a golden dagger up to her lips with one hand, and beckoning with
the other.

Guild of Shadows~
You seem to be in the lounging area in the Guild of Shadows, but even here
you cannot let your guard down...especially here.  Many respectable looking
citizens are lazing about the room, and your eyes widen as you wonder how
such common people could make their way into the guild house.  But then
you happen to notice how they all seem to be eyeing you, especially the
bulges in your pockets.  They are quite discreet about it, only glancing
at you casually every now and then, and looking at each other suspiciously.
If ever you have been in a den of vipers ready to strike, it is now.
The furnishings are as lavish as in the entrance room, though seemingly more
mismatched here...exotic objects and curious from around the globe ornament
the room.

Audrey's Terra Cotta Works~
At least three dozen lamps of - you guessed it - terra cotta, hang
from the slightly domed ceiling of this small shop, molded into
artistic renditions of goats, flower bouquets, mugs of ale, hunks
of cheese. You take it Audrey has a strange sense of humor. She is
here now, in rapt aesthetic concentration on a slab that is as yet
totally unidentifiable. She seems less interested in business than
in having an excuse to express herself.

Lokrath's Stables~
The mild scent of clean hay and well-kept horses reaches your senses as you
pass into the stables. Obviously the stable manager keeps himself busy.
The bridles, harnesses, saddles, blankets, and other equipment are hung
in meticulous care on polished brass racks, spare shoes arranged by size
dangle from pegs on the west wall, brushes and other tools set neatly in
folding trays, and feed in bails in back of the stalls, away from the long-
reaching necks of the fine breeds who shelter here.

Randall's Pawn Shop~
The lighting in this room is extremely poor, allowing you to faintly make
out that the room is piled and overflowing with any and every object that
you can imagine, and many that you cannot.  It is what you would expect from
any pawn shop, but you cannot help but amuse yourself by rummaging through
the huge heaps of dusty old trinkets.  Many a time you think you've found
something that would interest you, but before you can pay for it, it either
breaks or crumbles in your fingers.

sherry and a leather-bound book.

On the Serpent Circle, before the Main Road~
Townspeople pass rapidly along this street at its intersection with
the main road to the east like a fast-paced eddy off a great river.
Now and then some poor victim stumbles out of the arena to the north,
peering about quickly to see if anyone sees them in this state.

Less people mill through here, but the cobblestones of the street look
nevertheless no less worn down by age. A warm, salty wind manages to
thread through the passing heads of people and the high walls of the
city, reaching you and soothing your nerves. To the west lies the
main road, and Serpent Circle continues to the east.

traipsing out, confident their goods are safely on their way to their
intended destination. Small pots of flowers line the street at irregular
intervals, providing minute splashes of color to the otherwise pure
grey of the cobblestones and stone shops.

You can pick out the tax evaders by sight at this corner..for a few
not-as-inconspicuous-as-they-would-believe people slink like weasels
past the tax collector's to the north, obviously trying hard not to
break into a run. The few flower pots that used to sit here have been
smashed in the dead hours of the night by frustrated, angry townspeople,
leaving shards of terra cotta that crackle under the footsteps of
passersby.

The street in front of the town prison to the west has been littered
with bits of glass from ale bottles and cigar stubs, presumably the
refuse of the warden who resides there. The hoards of citizens who pass
through here seem not to notice, however, since they expect to see
familiar garbage strewn about.  The more self-righteous even deign to cast
disdainful glances in that direction before passing on to their more
important business.

hour is especially prominent here. The street continues south, and
forms an intersection to the north with Marandor Street.

Frais and Ghandi's Private Loft~
This inviting loft is comfortably decorated, reflecting the tastes of its
two inhabitants.  A bookshelf lines the wall to your left, stacked with all
manner of tomes, from arcane texts to romance novels.  The floor is highly
polished wood, and light shines down from the skylight high above, caressing
it mellowly.  You can hear the sounds from the busy streets of Trellor waft
in through a massive picture window, muffled somewhat by the thick vellum
curtains.
A fire crackles merrily along the west wall, warming the room, and sending
warm light cascading across the thick bearskin rug before it.  There is an
intimate dinner setting in the corner of the room, next to the cupboard
holding the china.
Partitioned off from the rest of the room by a japanese sliding paper door
is the couple's bedroom.  A massive, inviting four-poster bed dominates the
room, covered with pretty blue blankets.  A cute stuffed wombat rests on
the pillow, smiling at you with a stupid grin.
You notice a glimmer of metal from beneath the bed, and a strange metal chest
captures your eye.  You think it best not to ask.
You look around, wondering if either Ghandi or Frais is home, lingering on
the stairwell leading down to the inner sanctum of the Mudketeers.

for the many electronic gadgets you see around the room.  You smile
as you spot a sheer red robe with a monogrammed S on it and wonder who
it could belong to.

==============================
CHARTER OF THE CIRCLE OF POWER
==============================
This is just a short summary of the goals of the Circle of Power Clan.
If you have any further questions, just ask a member of the clan.
1) To work toward a friendlier and better MUD environment.
2) To help newbies in any way we can in the form of coins,
xp, items, advice, or protection.  These are to be given
as deemed and never in such a way that it imbalances game play.
3) To help Clan Members in need by providing clan funds and supplies.
Clan Philosophy:
1) Clan Members MUST help a newbie if they are being harrassed or
attacked by another player.  The point of this is to keep newbies
in the game.  Without them, we are nothing.  Newbies help us to
grow. Without newbies a Mud will eventually die out, we are here
to make certain that does not happen.
2) The Circle of Power will not participate in clan wars, however, we
will defend ourselves and allies if attacked.  We will NOT, however,
instigate such an incident.
1) New members should be at least 15th level, unless they have a higher
level character or are sponsored by a Command Council Member.
2) New members must first be sponsored by a member of the clan.
3) New members then must seek the approval of a Command Council member.
This must be obtained before a vote can be taken.
4) Once approval of a Clan Councilor is obtained, then all clan members
present in Medievia at the time will then vote.  If the new member
is approved by this vote, he/she/it then becomes a probationary
Clan Member.  This allows the new member to call upon the clan for
defense, but nothing else.
5) Then the new member will be assigned a quest by a Clan Councilor,
usually the First Officer.  This quest must be completed alone.
6) Upon completion of this quest, the new member will then be ordained
by the Clan Leader in a short ceremony.  The new member will then
be a full Clan Member and shall enjoy the rights and privileges
that such status grants him/her/it.
The Clan Leader has final say in new membership.

From somewhere to the south of you, you can make out the sweetly rising
and falling melodies of what you guess to be the famed Bardic Circle of
the city, but it seems miles away. A few winds manage to press themselves
over the high walls of the city and ruffle your hair as you gaze about you.

You have reached the bend of the southeast corner of Serpent Circle.
The road continues to the north and west. Someone has set small flowers
to grow in thin, soil-filled shelves built into the walls that lie to
the south and east of you.

Serpent Circle~
A warm wind carrying the scents of salty sea air and, more faintly,
breads baking in someone's ovens somewhere, drifts down this high-
walled street. The number of folk passing by is less here then on most
of the roads on town, and there is almost a semblance of peace.
The avenue continues east and west.

You find yourself walking along a wide, busy street that runs east-west
through the heart of Trellor.  It is in good repair, especially in light
of the number of people, horses, and carts that cross through it each and
every day.  To the far east you can see the eastern gate, and to the north
and south you see the Merchant Circle.

A score of travellers and townspeople mill in and out of this busy

smiling and bowing and flashing professional smiles. The main thorough-
fare of the city lies to the north, the square opens up to the south,
the town library lies west and the city chambers are east of here.

of Trellor rises above the ground in splendor. To the east lies the

Entrance to the Temple of Trellor~
This section of the Trellor Square is little different from the others, in
that it is covered by the same cobblestone.  But, the townspeople seem to
be distancing themselves from a strange looking object in the center of
the square.  They whisper amongst themselves and throw a few glances
at it, but their attitude seems to be one of awe and respect.  Deciding
to investigate further, you approach the strange shape, and are surprised
to see it is but a huge, ornately decorated, golden harp.  It stands
about once again your height and hums with a soft, gentle sound.  As you
examine it, a small group of people step in front of you and walk
straight into the strings...you see a glimmer of light...and they vanish!

doing. Some people seem to be gathered and whispering to the north.

of cross-streets leading to the shops and guilds.

dark blue. There is a mural on the ceiling depicting Trell, the ancient goddess
of music and matron of the city, in soft, faded hues. The books range from
newly- scribed to tattered, nearly illegible conditions, and are all devoted to
the lore and legends of this realm and others, far away. There is a sign
listing briefly the commands for using the board.

Library of Trellor~
A glass globe of soft amber light hangs suspended by a chain from the ceiling

read the bulletin board, dominating the room from its mount on the wall. Around
it are a few more shelves of books, but mostly written in the old language of
Trellor, and not understandable to you.
A librarian sells items for correspondance.

This is a spacious room filled with natural light and furnished with

someone can be found here unable to put down some important papers or
other, rattling them in the candlelight, and hulking and scribbling over
one of the tables. The windows are draped with a thin, modest tan
velvet, and the rug is woven and ornate.

Office of the Duke of Trellor~
It looks like this room has been kept to an obsessive minimum of
decoration. The single window to the north is hung with thin white
cotton cloth, the desk large and, oddly for such a busy mayor, nearly
bare. You then notice a small closet in the south wall, with tips of
papers peeking out from under the door...the place must be packed
with documents.

desk~
A large oak desk balanced by a book of law under one leg sits in front of you.
It is scattered with unsigned papers and books of all sorts.  A small
sack of jewels and gold gets your attention.  You reach forward and think
to yourself, 'Humm, maybe not.'

A Hallway in the Temple of Trellor~
You look around to find yourself in a large hallway in the Temple of
Trellor. The entire hallway, and, as far as you can see, the entire
temple seems to be worked completely out of pale blue marble!  The
craftmanship is elaborate, and the designs magnificent.  Musical instruments
of every imaginable size, shape and make have been carved over and over
in overlapping patterns across the walls and ceiling.  A thin, sky blue
carpet covers the ground, and leads northward as far as you can see.
A small alcove is to your west, and a large, magnificent golden harp,
sister to the one you used to enter the temple, is near another wall.

A Marble Alcove~
You find yourself in a small, enclosed marble alcove.  A large sign painted
in gold script upon a large cloth of blue velvet is spread loosely across
the western wall.  There are small cubby holes carved out of the solid
marble lining the room on all sides.  They are apparently for storage
purposes, but of what, you have not the faintest idea.

statue~
You lean back and marvel at the beauty of a statue of a great and powerful King.
As you try to glance at the face of this granite statue the glare hits your eyes
causing you to be blinded from its face no matter where you stand.  The one thing you
notice is that the statue seems to look at you when you move.

A Hallway in the Temple of Trellor~
You walk along the temple's main hallway, following a pale blue rug that
cushions your feet like water. Hangings of ancient silk adorn the walls
of both sides, depicting scenes from the myths of Trell. Shown on one
is the goddess handing a gleaming golden apple to a satyr about to
hurl his flute to the sea, on another, the same goddess, altered by
the brushes of a different artist, is pictured playing a giant golden
harp at the wedding of a king and queen of eons ago. The striking thing
in this one is the harp is fully without strings...you notice an
insciption at the base of the hanging and read it. 'Only Trell has the
bardic skill to play the Windharp, plucking the winds for her songs
in place of strings.'

Standing Before the Marble Steps~
You stand before the gently sloping steps of the temple.  They are as
wondrously smooth as silk, even after thousands of years, and seem
to shine with a soft light. The pale rug ends here at the base, and
narrow earthen paths lead east and west. Harmonious, soothing voices
float down from somewhere atop the stairs.

The Terrace of the Temple~
Murals of Trell adorn the ceiling of this indoor terrace, painted
with inspired strokes by artists long deceased. They overlap and
blend into each other, like a watery collage, in muted blue, amber,
silvery-grey and rose colors. They are hypnotic to gaze at, but
even more alluring are the voices of what seem to be children,
echoing gently in song from the towering Dome ahead of you.

The pale blue sky replaces the ceiling of marble, and several low-hanging
trees are here, basking in the light and providing shade for a host of
small sun-timid plants. You recognize violets of soft whites and purples,
surrounded by many species of deep green moss. Beautiful ivory-colored
birds whirl about just above the treetops.

The Temple Dome~
 A feeling of hushed awe washes over you as you enter the Great Dome of the
Temple of the goddess Trell. A silken marble floor as blue and milky as the
morning sky caresses your tired feet with a coolness befitting the clouds. The
massive dome of this room rises over a hundred feet above you, and is carved
into a delicate filigree pattern, like a great shroud of marble lace, allowing
light but not rain to filter through. From alcoves to the east and west, soft
chimelike voices can be heard, melting in with the gentle sounds of water
splashes from the fountain at the room's center. The sides of the fountain are
carved with ornate ancient symbols and designs, and a tall marble statue of a
woman of unearthly beauty rises from the center, gleaming in the light that
floods from above. Many folk of all walks of life are here, shedding their
daily identities for a while to refresh from the fountain and worship their
deity.

A Choir Alcove~
 You pass under an arch carved with the overlaying, curved forms of musical
notation used in Trellor, and sloping outwards to give off ample sound. Poised
on steps ascending to the opposite wall are several children, born both of the
city and other realms far away, who have come to live at the Temple and train
to serve its goddess. Their voices are as differing as their complexions and
dialects, but blend together into a perfect flow of melody and harmony, deep
and light tones. Their woven song can be heard throughout the Temple, but at
this close proximity is especially awe-inspiring.

A Hallway in the Temple of Trellor~
Subtle smells of sweetgrass and myrrh incense float down from atop
a short staircase of marble, colored like rose and smoky quartz laced
with wandering lines of black. The music of the choirs is still
detectable, coming from the south, but less prominent. Worshippers
from many lands move on past you with occasional glances and shy
smiles.

The High Altar~
 Here at the altar of Trell, the goddess of music, strict silence is observed
by the many worshippers who throng here to pay homage, silence being recognized
as the medium for the birth of song. The marble roof has given way to the azure
of the sky, and the songs of the four winds provide the only sounds to be
heard. The altar is engraved from a sleek black wood unfamiliar to you, and lit
by the lurid glow of silver lamps hung from four posts in the room's corners.
The incense of sweetgrass and myrrh is tended by a mute priestess, the only
resident of the Temple who knows not how to sing nor play, for the sake of
purity. A statue of white marble rises above the altar, in the form of a
beautiful woman, clothed in a rippling gown and blank of face. You feel a deep
sense of serenity and even some fear - the fear that begs for inspiration -
exuding from the worshippers.

 You descend the ancient stone stairs to find yourself within a small, solemn
room glowing with the unusually white light of amber beeswax candles, and
furnished with a table and a thick black rug. A globe hangs suspended by magic
in the air, a map of the known world, and someone's pet faerie dragon grins at
you from her perch on a stand of silver. There is an ash pit against the far
wall where countless mages before you have perfected their deadly fireball.

The Swordmaster Training Room~
You are in a huge, partitioned room, most of it well lit, but a few
sections nearly pitch black.  You hear the cries of battle and metal
clashing upon metal from nearly every direction.  Swordmasters and
their most advanced pupils are locked in what looks, to the untrained eye,
to be mortal combat.  In other sections, you see blindfolded warriors
attempting to dodge blows from wooden swords, and, sometimes, even real
steel. The mark distinguishing the teachers from the pupils is that of
a calm, deadly grace, but even the students have begun to exhibit this
trait, though to a lesser extent.

Four windowless walls of granite comprise the prison office. There
is a shabby brown rug spread on the floor that smells of old spilt
ale and cigar ash, and behind a wooden desk sits the prison warden.
A ring of keys hang by a hook from a pocket in his jerkin, displayed
like a badge, and available for easy access. He recieves all the
free ale and smokes he desires while at work, and accordingly
there sits a wooden case of cigars and a crate full of warm drink
beside him. He looks up at you from his mug, wondering what you are
here for.

The Prison Hall~
A single dim torch provides the only light for the prison hall. From
the dank smells of mildew and waste you guess that there has been a
pipe leakage unmended for quite some time, and you shiver to think
just how long. The floor of the hall is covered with a thin dark
slime and you catch sight of the tail of a rat as it disappears
down a crack in the bottom of a wall. Besides these unpleasantries,
it strikes you that the warden may not be pleased to find you
lurking about down here, and you resolve to make this a short stay.
On all sides are rank-smelling prison cells, inhabited by those
found on the wrong side of the law.

This is the healing facility of kind-hearted Lucretia, who is well-

warrior sons. Some townspeople joke that there would be no one to
fill the town guard positions were it not for her skill at bandaging
guards who are wounded in battle.  The wooden walls of the infirmary
are hung with small simple paintings, and a couple of Audrey's
bizarre terra cotta lamps. Shelves covered with herbal salves,
tinctures and cloth bandages are all along two walls.

Church of Trellor~
You pass through the arch of ancient stone onto a thin soft rug of
the deepest jade that leads from the entrance to a wide oak altar
at the western end of church. On the altar are a black prayer cloth,
a clay bowl of incense, a clear jar of beads, and a polished wooden
figurine with a blank face, symbolizing the great multitude of deities
that are worshipped here. The occasional murmurings of prayer can
be heard, and a faint scent of myrrh is in the air. You feel
immediately far removed from the buzz of the city going about its
business. Gazing about at this sanctuary for clerics alone, you feel
very much within your own element.

unwind. From somewhere you hear the faint murmured song of a monk

Down inside these unadorned walls of whitewashed stone there is a

that you feel almost completely unaware of other priests and
priestesses on their quiet ways in and out of the room. The scent
of herbs is pleasant and faint, the air is still and the distant
humming of prayer only adds to the silence.

Warm dry winds blow in from the sea, and the clamor of the busy
city seems far below. A giant iron bell hangs here by thick chains;
this place is a most peaceful one for meditation, save for when
the bell rings out the hour. A simple clay jar ornamented with
symbols holds choices of incense for the contemplative to use
as they wish.

are here clustered about a large tarnished brass bowl, which is
placed prominently in front so as to make it obvious donations are
encouraged. The loud music of a rowdy tavern song fills the room,
mingling with the fragrant smoke of local tobacco and sweet smelling
wine. At each break in the song, at least one of the players manages
to dextrously tip his feathered hat to the ground and have it back on
his head before an eye's blink. You feel warmed by their showman's
smiles and well-inclined to donate to the cause of merry-making.

A Path through the Gardens~
You follow a narrow earthen trail through natural beds of trailing
hyacinth, hanging moss, fur-leafed violets and a number of other
plants. Low-hanging trees provide ample shade from the direct glare
of the sun and beautiful ivory-feathered birds swirl in the air just
above you.

The path reaches an impasse here, as thick white-flowering hedges bar
your way north, east and west. You can brush aside the birds to seat
yourself on a bench of cool grey marble, or return back south to view
more of the temple gardens.

An Ivory Statue~
A deep sense of serenity surrounds this tall statue of white like a
blanket of first snow. The statue, though blank of face, suggests a
beautiful figure of a goddess, her head supine in meditation, arms
at her sides, with palms outward. Even the birds seem to sense the
quite awe that pervades here, and do not land on her ivory body.

Entrance to the Suburbs of Trellor~
The pale grey stones of the street are worn down almost to a smooth surface
by the heavy traffic of citizens passing through here every day to and from
their business in the city. The main road lies to the north, leading to the
town's heart, and the peaceful residences of the townsfolk lie to the south.

Rough hewn stone steps lead up the side of this steep, lightly forested
slope that is known to all locals as Rose Hill, for the number of wild
roses that can be spotted blooming among the trees and bushes. The road
continues south through a narrow, dark tunnel leading out of the city,
and north to the crossroads with Kestrel Lane and Cypress Road.

You follow uneven lines of oaks and planted cypress trees along this narrow

leafy or needled limbs. The smell of woodsmoke is thin in the air, and you
feel desirous of a good meal and a night of relaxation. The crossroads
is to the east of here, and Cypress Road continues west.

relaxing and harvesting the fine fruits. The lane continues to the east

small conifers and woodsmoke of cooking fires lures you to your bed at
home, or tempts you to find a place to camp off the roadside somewhere.
Unfortunately, you have a notion that a few of the residents might have
a word or two to say about that.

along the hill. To the north you can make out the many rooftops of the city,
and even catch bits of the busy humming noises of bardic singing, clopping
horses, and the occasional shouting of a town guard. Several residences
lie nestled among trees along paths to the south, and the scent of wild
wood roses, for which the hill was named, greets your senses and makes you
feel at home.

The earth road widens out and comes to an end, with homes to the north and
south of you. The limbs of trees, crowded by the walls of houses, cluster
together and brush the faces of anyone who passes through here without
ducking.

Kestrel Lane~
The high wall of the city towers above you to the east, impeding your
progress there. It seems to you the town walls are even higher surrounding
the residential section than the city proper, but perhaps it is only
that you feel extraordinarily safe here. The lane continues north and
south.

Kestrel Lane~
The delicious smells of fried apples and other foods cooking over fires
drifts in from the west, where a few houses seem to lie, nestled into
the scattered trees, much like the others you have seen. The lane
leads that way, and also continues north. The high eastern wall bars
the way east, and hedges to the south make that way impassable.

lives near here is an active cook. The lane returns east.

Wynter's Winter Home~
The Winter Home has been decorated with white and transparent glass.  It
seems spacious, with the walls melding seamlessly into the floor and ceiling
in such a way as to provide the illusion that you're outside... if outside
were a blinding snowstorm.  The air is invigoratingly chill, creating a
feeling of comfort despite the cold.
On the central glass table is an exquisitely carved ice sculpture, and a
small white placard is stuck to the door.

Rough hewn stairs lead down into a cave.  The cave appears to have been hollowed
out under the root network of a large and very old tree.  A few furs have been
piled in a corner to serve as bedding.  Rough shelves have been carved from
available roots, and there is even a stone-lined fireplace.  Scraps of iron,
leftover bits of food, and wolf hairs complete the cave's decoration.

Hall of Darkness~
 You stand in the Hall of Darkness, the meeting place of the Brotherhood.
Streams of blood red wine flow from grotesque yet lifelike statues. Shrouded
figures escort you past writhing bodies nailed to the walls of the audience
chamber. Sitting on a throne of skulls sits Delmarr, assassin of the
Brotherhood. To his right cloaked in an aura of Darkness is Tab, Priest of this
dark flock. The imposing figure of Lord Tulkus stands on the Dais before you,
awaiting any treachery you may intend with zealous fury. Darkened clansmen
surround you with murderous intent, pray you're here for a good reason.
A small shine to Ugadal and Vehn glitters here.
The treasure of the Brotherhood lies at your feet.

Large, juicy plums dangle and weigh the limbs of the several trees down,
giving them a slight dripping appearance that only increases the romantic
feel of this small garden among the houses. This is a popular place for
picnics or star-gazing for the citizens. The alluring scents of plums
make your mouth water, and invite you to stay.

nestled among some large trees.  The clearing gives you a feeling
of great peace, it seems like a good place to rest and refresh
yourself.

You pass into the dark of a tunnel barely wide enough for a cart to pass
through. This does not seem to deter the traffic, however, and you
realize it may take you a while to get through this swarm of travellers,
horses pulling small carts, and even pets. To the north the light brightens
with the opening of the tunnel, and to the south lies the path out of town.

Myst's Place~
The house at this end of the path on Rose Hill is oddly indistinct
and hazy.  Closer inspection of the translucent walls reveal that
they have been constructed from large, clear crystal spheres slightly
resembling dragons and mortared with white crystalline powder.
Inside the house is filled with greyish mist.  Soft light from nowhere
brings the mist to a twilight glow.  The mist seems to be in constant
motion, and occasionally out of the corner of your eye spots of
color flash in and out of existence.
Suddenly, the shadowy mist seems to coalesce into the form of a laughing
woman with short red hair and mist-grey eyes, then the figure vanishes
back into vapor, leaving you to wonder if the owner, Myst, is somewhere
in the shadows...

Thankfully, perhaps, the light grows here as the stifling tunnel opens out.

city's southern gate, with roads leading off into little-known realms
you may have seen pictured in the town's many murals and tomes.

hesitation for travelling beyond the city's safe walls, or headed north,
pleased to be home and looking forward to a fine time of relaxation and
boasting of conquests (be they fact or very tall tales indeed). The road
continues south, the town and its suburbs lie through the tunnel to the
north.

This is certainly not somewhere you want to be spending too much of your
leisure time.  The sewers of Trellor are no different from any other sewer
that you have wandered through, and there have been many, it is dimly
lit by torches placed in even spaces along the walls.  You find yourself
wading through stale, rank water that overflows into your boots, which annoys
you to no end.  The putrid stench eminating from the sewage fills your lungs,
so humid that you nearly choke on it.  Sewer rats, snakes, and other native
vermin scurry about, not paying you much notice at all.

Sewers beneath Trellor~
This is certainly not somewhere you want to be spending too much of your
leisure time.  The sewers of Trellor are no different from any other sewer
that you have wandered through, and there have been many.  It is dimly
lit by torches placed in even spaces along the walls.  You find yourself
wading through stale, rank water that overflows into your boots, annoying
you to no end.  The putrid stench eminating from the sewage fills your lungs,
so humid that you nearly choke on it.  Sewer rats, snakes, and other native
vermin scurry about, not paying you much notice at all.

Sewers beneath Trellor~
This is certainly not somewhere you want to be spending too much of your
leisure time.  The sewers of Trellor are no different from any other sewer
that you have wandered through, and there have been many.  It is dimly
lit by torches placed in even spaces along the walls.  You find yourself
wading through stale, rank water that overflows into your boots, annoying
you to no end.  The putrid stench eminating from the sewage fills your lungs,
so humid that you nearly choke on it.  Sewer rats, snakes, and other native
vermin scurry about, not paying you much notice at all.

This is certainly not somewhere you want to be spending too much of your
leisure time.  The sewers of Trellor are no different from any other sewer
that you have wandered through, and there have been many.  It is dimly
lit by torches placed in even spaces along the walls.  You find yourself
wading through stale, rank water that overflows into your boots, annoying
you to no end.  The putrid stench eminating from the sewage fills your lungs,
so humid that you nearly choke on it.  Sewer rats, snakes, and other native
vermin scurry about, not paying you much notice at all.

Hallway in the Motherhouse~
Darkness embraces you with her warm gentle caress as you wander through the
hallway in the Guild of Shadows.  The hallway is not wide, but the deep
shadows caused by the dim lighting and the torches placed sparingly on the
walls gives it that illusion.  Your eyes adjust quickly, for this is your
element, and this is the preferrable atmosphere for you to perform your
work.

The Medievian Medics Clan Hall~
You have entered the Clan Hall of the Medievian Medics. The ceilings of this
hall rise thirty feet up to a set of rafters, which hang the standards of
each of the members. Along the back wall there is a small elf, watching
the life monitors of each clan member. Along the southern wall there are
shelves with all manner of clerical items, used by the medics to heal and
save lives. There is a huge table in the middle of the hall, surrounded
by twenty comfortable chairs. Woundtaker's chair is set at the head of
the table. A huge fireplace is set along the entire northen wall. There
is a fire burning there at the present, warming the room.

Lunch's Private Dining Room~
This is where Lunch conducts business and has friends over for lunch. A
long, rectangular oak table occupies the center of the room. The table
is surrounded by several comfy cushioned chairs. A pleasant aroma assails
your nose, obviously emanating from the huge feast that adorns the table.
The best food of the realm is here, prepared using Lunch's secret recipes.
Goblets full of fine wine sit by empty plates waiting to be filled with
the food that meets your fancy. A small bar sits in the northwest corner
of the room, where Lunch will be happy to mix your favorite drink.
Through tinted windows you can get a great view of the buzzing activity
of Merchant Circle to the north. The walls are decorated with an array
of dirks and daggers, just a small portion of his collection.

A Cozy Empty Apartment~
A few giant bean bags of dark green have been dragged up here from below.
No one lives here, but apparently no landlord has objections to people using
this room to chat. Even in its barrenness, the room is quite comfortable,
with a single large, decoratively paned window looking north out on the
colorful minstrels of Merchant Circle. A very large cat has taken up
residence here.

You are standing upon the Docks of Trellor.  The wooden planks beneath your
feet feel quite sturdy indeed.  The soft ocean breeze blows your hair gently
back away from your face, and you can taste salt water upon the tip of your
tongue. You cannot help but raise your hands out to your sides, close your
eyes and drink deeply from this deliciously salty air.

Entrance to the Docks of Trellor~
To the north you see the huge docks of Trellor, chock full of ships of nearly
every imaginable size.  Even as you watch, you see a huge sea vessel docking
in the pier, and a plethora of exotic looking people pouring out of it,
chattering wildly as they point this way and that.  You cannot help but
smile...foreigners. To the south looms a massive, heavily fortified
stronghold which more closely resembles a fortress than any city that you have
ever seen.  The walls are nearly four times your height and the city gates
are surrounded by a troop of heavily armed cityguards.

travelers who have been completely and thoroughly searched for illegal
items of one form or another.  What could possibly be the reason for such
extreme precaution?  To the far north you can see the beginnings of a pier.

Eleon Avenue~
You see the rear of Trellor's commercial section to your south, and the
high, invincible city walls to your north.  The waste and trash left by
the shopkeepers is strewn about the ground behind their buildings, and
a fairly rancid odor can be detected in the air.  All manner of vermin
crawl about through the garbage, only stopping to stare at you every so
often.

A Bend in Eleon Avenue~
The high walls surrounding the city hamper your vision to the north and to
the west.  It is quite odd that such a seemingly secure little city would
have need of such staunch fortification as provided by these tall, formidable
stone walls.  It seems that you are in the northeastern most part of
Trellor. Eleon Avenue continues to the west and Kilran Way to the south.

The Main Road of Trellor~
The main road leading into town is very heavily traveled, and as you pass
by the many travelers along the way, they examine you carefully,
some of them giving you odd or curious expressions.  This is clearly a
town of great diversity, as you can see from the myriad of different
styles of dress, speech, and other mannerisms...and it is also a town of
great secrecy.

a closer look, and run headfirst into a thick sheet of clear glass that
has been placed over the money, to protect it.  The money is in any and
every form imaginable, coins, paper currency, and even small engraved marbles,
specially marked cloth strips, and other strange things.  Finally you force
yourself to look away and you see a large counter to the west, stacked
neatly with papers and ledgers, with writing utensils in a neat pile within
easy reach.

Soulstealer's Weapon Shop~
You look around to find yourself in a massive room, brimming with weapons
of every imaginable size, shape and origin.  One entire wall is covered with
different types of swords: long swords, short swords, two-handed swords,
rapiers, sabres, epees, and even swords to which you cannot put a name.
Two other walls of the room are covered in the same fashion, but with
other types of weapons.  A common factor to every object of destruction that
you see in this room is that they are obviously not of the best quality, and
have been produced fairly rapidly for sale to the average, and not elite,
adventurer.

A large, room full of broken armor and weapons, with tools to repair them, lays
out before you.  Little bits and pieces, chips of metal, wood, and other
materials litter the floor, so you must watch your step.  The heat from a
forge bakes your skin as you pass by it, and you splash some water from a
basin over your face.  It's not a pretty, well kept room, but it serves
its functional purpose.

On the Merchant Circle, before Marandor Street~
Walking along the western portion of the Merchant Circle, your movement
is impeded on nearly all sides by the huge flow of bodies going about their
daily chores.  The plethora of shops on each side of the road boggles your
mind as you imagine what you could buy if you but had the money.  The soft,
pleasant music of the street minstrels flows through the air, calming your
nerves somewhat.

Khal's Jewellery~
Khal grins at you as you enter his shop, showing a ready flash of
white teeth against dark skin. He touches his turban in a nervous
habit and claps his hands together as you survey the place..a well
lit room enclosed with cases whose contents sparkle tauntingly.
He suggests eagerly that you ask for his list of stock.

This comfortable room is inhabited by a receptionist, who will show
you to your bed to sleep until your return to Trellor. An overstuffed
sofa sits against the west wall, the receptionists desk is near the
north wall. The desk is cluttered with several plants, bookmarks,
paper and pens.

Western Gate of Trellor~
The huge iron bars blocking the entrance to the city are very conspicuous
indeed. A group of guards is constantly on watch, admitting only those
travelers who have been completely and thoroughly searched for illegal
items of one form or another.  What could possibly be the reason for such
extreme precautions?  The entire process is a very efficient one, and
travelers pour in at a constant rate.  To the east you see Marandor Street,
and to the north and south you see Mondrea Road.

You find yourself walking along a wide, busy street that runs east-west

of the number of people, horses, and carts that cross through it each and
every day.  To the west you see the western gate, and to the east sprawls
the expansive business section of Trellor.

the magical supplies for sale anytime you wish, and back down again.
You pause nevertheless to peer at several clear jars displaying
faerie dust, pixie wings, the tips of elven ears, and other odd
objects like candy.

the smells of common ale and the sweet wine preferred by the minstrels
of Trellor. Bonk the Cleaver thumps you on the shoulder for no
apparent reason except perhaps to show you that the tavern is
equipped with a prominent bouncer.  The townspeople mill in and out
with the expectation of filling their stomachs with some good drink.

from customers as they continuously clap each other on the back about
you-dont-know-what. The noise of a popular bawdy tune floats down from
upstairs.

The Crystal Blue Ocean~
The light reflecting off the cool water's surface causes you to squint
slightly as you pass along the surface of the ocean. As far as you can
see to the east, the ocean continues interminably. Cliffs golden-white
with sand lie to the west.

floor sand corel~
The sand beneth you is strange.  It contains many different arrays of
colored sand.  A swirling blue, red, orange and silve bottom puts you
into a deep trance of relaxation.  Many types of special corel latch
on to the bottom of the sand.  All various colors of the rainbow
can be seen.  A black entity sways in the current.  You wonder if you

of the cheap wood the hovel is fashioned from. Smoke rings are rising languidly

Hallway in the Motherhouse~
Darkness embraces you with her warm gentle caress as you wander through the
hallway in the Guild of Shadows.  The hallway is not wide, but the deep
shadows caused by the dim lighting and the torches placed sparingly on the
walls gives it that illusion.  Your eyes adjust quickly, for this is your
element, and this is the preferrable atmosphere for you to perform your
work.

The Assassin's Practice Room~
You are engulfed in the darkness as soon as you enter this room, but your
eyes are quick to adjust, and you must be, for daggers whistle through the
air barely inches from your body.  You instinctively rise upon the balls
of your feet, and crouch low to the ground, feeling your way toward the
nearest wall.  From this safer vantage point you see dim shapes lurking
about the room, the glint of silver faintly visible in the lighting provided
by a single candle placed in the center of the room.  You hear a loud,
crashing sound and a scream, a trap has just been set off.  You breathe
deeply and open yourself up to your senses...this is what it means to be
truly alive!

for so intently, you cannot even imagine.  To the northwest you can see

wandering about, rummaging through the garbage, human and animal alike.
You try to make yourself inconspicuous, for standing out in a place like

you see something skulking there...or are you just imagining things?

Northwest Corner of the Docks~
There are a number of ships tied to the dock, so many that you cannot even
begin to count them.  Most of them are not very large, but a few gigantic
vessels fill your view, travelers pouring out of them steadily, with
packages and baggage in hand.  The smell of seawater is strong in the air,
and your face is gently sprayed by a cooling mist of water.  Far to the
south you see the sprawling City of Trellor.

Thieves Hideaway~
After a cautious descent into the flickering shadows of this cellar, you
are surprised to find this place rather comfortable. Everything a thief
hiding out from the wanted lists would desire is here....a small bar,
wooden card table, an ice crate chilling some carnivorous snacks, bean
bag chairs, even a sort of phonograph that seems in working condition.

The Battle Tower~
Twined belt of braided crimson silk hang across the circular walls of this
dense stone tower built to defend the city. To the east you can make out
the rooftops of the town over its high walls, and make out the din of voices
immersed in trade, prayer and song. To the west the jagged road leads to the
stream, beyond which you cannot see.

The Windy Stream~
You sail the stream, mildly tossed and buffeted by winds blowing in from the
west, and smelling of uncharted wilderness....hills, forests, waters that have
yet to be explored, by god and mortal alike. The water is a shimmering pale
blue-grey, and leads north and south. The landing and road leading to the city
are to the east.

 Quite suddenly the narrow stream bed opens out and gives way to the broad
northern sea, faithfully reflecting the whites and blues of the sky. In the
distance, far offshore, you can barely make out the outline of a deadly pirate
ship....but you feel safely unseen here, and there is no dock for them to land
at this place. Some sort of thin path leads west over a rocky outcrop.

of Finch. He lounges now on a black leather couch, eyeing you and
the bags you carry. A small squat table that seems to serve for a
desk is in the corner, covered with metal cans of cigars and an
ice-filled bin of cheap ale. You begin to wonder if a self-respecting
girl might be less trouble.

Fitch's Woodworking~
Fitch the carver was very upset to find the least expensive shop in
town was next door to the brothel, but he does his best to alleviate
the foul smells wafting in from there by burning incense and whatever
else comes in handy. He has spread cedar wood chips over the floor
in place of a rug to help the stench problem and create an atmosphere.
None of his works are on display, for he is quite egotistical, and
spends a good deal of energy feigning modesty. Customers must ask to
peruse his latest goods.

The Spider's Web~
As a result of hard passionate labor, the entire floor of this shop
has been woven over with very fine colored threads into a tight mesh
of intricate design. It is considered one of the prettiest sights in
Trellor, drawing many foreigners from strange lands. Emma, another
ex-gypsy almost as attractive as her work, sits at her loom designing
some expensive woven shawl.

College of the Mystical Arts~
You pass through a great arch of fine marble into the distinguished
College of Mystical Arts. There are cabinets of ice-glass placed
with precision in each of the four corners of the room, filled with
odd glowing objects that seem to have some significance. The floor
has been laid with a smooth rug of cool grey, to lessen the
amplification of noise from the echoing effects of marble.

College of the Mystical Arts~
The founder of the college is immortalized in a portrait on the far
wall. You are slightly startled to see that by means of magic he
can shift positions and smile at the people he knows. You begin to
wonder if mages know no real death, for the founder has been
passed away for over two centuries.

Bend in the Merchant Circle~
You are at a bend in the southwestern portion of the Merchant Circle.
Crowds of people, each moving with a purpose, swirl about you as they go
about their daily duties.  The number of shops surrounding you is
overwhelming...there is nothing you could not buy if you but had the
money.

Silk's Leather Shop~
The smoke of incense that fills this room makes the air rather stifling,
but the atmosphere is still pleasant enough. The walls of this room seem
to use the finer leather works of Silk's creation for their decoration.
Silk, who used to be a gypsy, is here behind a table absentmindedly
humming as she works on a hide. You finally catch her attention by
stepping too close to a high quality leather whip she especially
treasures.

Sewers beneath Trellor~
This is certainly not somewhere you want to be spending too much of your
leisure time.  The sewers of Trellor are no different from any other sewer
that you have wandered through, and there have been many.  It is dimly
lit by torches placed in even spaces along the walls.  You find yourself
wading through stale, rank water that overflows into your boots, annoying
you to no end.  The putrid stench eminating from the sewage fills your lungs,
so humid that you nearly choke on it.  Sewer rats, snakes, and other native
vermin scurry about, not paying you much notice at all.

The Main Road of Trellor~
The main road leading into town is very heavily traveled, and as you pass
by the many travelers along the way, they examine you carefully,
some of them giving you odd or curious expressions.  This is clearly a
town of great diversity, as you can see from the myriad of different
styles of dress, speech, and other mannerisms...and it is also a town of
great secrecy.

 Cedar oil lamps hung at regular intervals along the walls near the ceiling
give a warm amber glow to this popular hangout. Small round mahogany tables
with matching chairs are set about the place, and two miniature overstuffed
sofas are pulled in to a large stone fireplace that crackles from the flames
inside. Books lie scattered about, and the place smells fully of hot, delicious
coffee. There is a coffee fountain by a counter attended by a young girl.

Two long polished wooden tables run lengthwise down the restaurant,
which has a reputation of serving *very* oversized portions of good
hearty food.  The room smells of rich spiced rabbit, tender venison in
sage sauce, (imported and) peppered gryphon stew, basiled duck
with pasta.....getting hungry yet? Oddly, Lunch is nowhere to be
seen. A serving boy covers his absence, explaining absentmindedly
that he had to go put on his 'dark inconspicuous clothing' to go
'obtain' some supplies. Hmm.

The Balladeer Music Hall~
An old mural of the goddess of music, Trell, catches your eye from its
place on the ceiling. It is intended to inspire you to buy from this
shop, the supplier of instruments to all of the minstrels of the city.
It is even rumored some of the instruments exhibit faint magical
powers. Many violins, mandolins, flutes and the like are displayed in
cases of glass, all of which are in conditions varying from excellent to
barely restored from many battered years of use.

You check yourself in with the guards through the large gate which
is the only entrance into the towering fortified structure that is the
Battlemaster's Stronghold.  Despite the harsh, plain approach to the
architecture of the building, you cannot see a speck of dust anywhere.
The walls are lined with various coats of arms, shields, suits of armor,
weapons, and other implements of the warrior.

The Demon Summoning Room~
You enter the darkness of the demon summoning lair, sanctuary to the evil
clerics that lurk within the city's walls. The air is humid and reeks of
the exotic smells of rue and blood, though whether the blood is human or
not remains a mystery. An ornately-carved altar of ebony wood stands against
the north wall, littered chaotically with fragments of hair, bone, broken
glass and incense, and stained with dried blood. The cracked mirror above
it shows you your own reflection by the light you hold, against a grisly
mural of the Unnamed Demon Queen on the south wall. The dark rug is covered
with ash from the demonfire spells used by the priests to exterminate
their demons, once their business with them is through.

Hallway in the Fortress~
Walking through a hallway in the fortress you examine the various coats of
arms lining the walls.  One stands out above all of the rest, a golden
dragon with crimson scales upon a field of pale green.  In one claw the
dragon holds a lighted sceptre, and a spear with a diamond arrow-head in
the other.  This must be the emblem that represents this stronghold's own
Battlemaster.

lighting fixture lamp~
A glowing acove houses a large lighting fixutre.  It was once
grandeur, now decrepid from age.  A mosh like webbing flows endlessly
around its crystal talons.  A bright light in the center stands out as
the most beautiful part of this light.  A bright blue eridescent
glow sheaths the room clearly marking the exits.

A Large Pier~
You are standing upon the Docks of Trellor.  The wooden planks beneath your
feet feel quite sturdy indeed.  The soft ocean breeze blows your hair gently
back away from your face, and you can taste salt water upon the tip of your
tongue. You cannot help but raise your hands out to your sides, close your
eyes and drink deeply from this deliciously salty air.

A large sign on the edge of the docks reads: "Welcome to Trellor City!"
                                               All visitors must report to
                                               the gate for assistance!"

A Dank Shaft~
A musty, rank scent almost overwhelms your senses as you descend, half-
climbing, half-sliding, down a wet, narrow shaft.
You hope you can just make it to the sanctuary in time to save your skin
..for you hear the footfalls of an approaching enemy.

A Dimly Lit Sanctuary~
You wade knee-deep in a muddy pool of which you dare not question the
contents. However, you are safe, you are sound...free to heal the
wounds inflicted by your rivals, and by means of magic, to guard
against anticipated attacks.

The Inner Sanctum of the Mudketeers~
     The ceiling of this solemn hall arches into darkened shadows high above
you.  Your footsteps echo hollowly around you as you step into this sombre,
yet inviting building.
     Trophies from the many glorious battles of the Mudketeers line the walls.
From the crude scimitars of orcan raiders to dark, battered shields, engraved
with the evil runes used by the enemies of order.  Many such relics of war
hang on stands about the room.
     A fireplace dominates the western wall, with a merry fire crackling
within.  You feel an overwhelming urge to sit on the bearskin rug before it
an rest.  The flames send light dancing across the walls, illuminating the
mementos, and several bookshelves holding many thickset tomes, which appear
to be resting indifferently, merely gathering dust.
     The firelight twinkles happily, reflecting in a polished silver plaque,
which has been set over the mantel.  Engraved into the plaque is the motto:
                 "all for one, and one for all"
     A massive, arched double door offers an exit to the north, leading onto
Serpent Circle, and the busy streets of Trellor.

Sanctuary of the Templars~
You enter a large stone stronghold which serves as a sanctuary for travelling
Templars and an outpost for battle and war. All about you are knights
readying their equipment and preparing for travel and exploration. You notice
a holy priest walking amongst them, bestowing blessings from his god and
uttering strange charms. Amidst all the activity, you see a crazy old beggar
sitting crosslegged on the floor of the common. No one acknowledges his
presence, yet he goes on and on rambling about a city of stone and forests
filled with giants and centaurs. You chuckle at the poor man, and continue
on your way, wondering if he'll ever regain his sanity.

Achad's Office and Deadhead Haven~
As you step through the beads in the doorway, you find yourself listening
to the Grateful Dead in a beautiful room, with just a touch of incense
floating through the air. A smile crosses your face and you just can't
help but be happy! The colorful room is decorated with brilliant tie-dye
banners, posters of the Dead, and various photographs of the band. On the
far wall is a large cassette rack, at least 10 feet wide, containing a
pristine recording of every show the Dead have ever played. There is a
wooden table in the middle of the room carved like a Yin-Yang sign, and
about it are piles of comfortable pillows to relax upon. Some bookshelves
adorn the wall to your right, and to your left is a desk with a large
computer system. As you glance at the screen, you see a little blue
Dancing Bear screen-saver strutting about, and on the far wall is a
Dancing Bear poster!

Cosmo and Ame's Celestial Fantasy~
Your first glance immediately tells your senses that this room is different
from all other rooms in Medievia.  It is spherical in shape, wrapping around
you in a never ending circle of dark grey stone and yet somehow a circle
of light that floods your eyes and warms your body.  Looking out a nearby
window the beautiful landscape of Trellor proper stretches out before you.
BLINK!...suddenly the room changes...the entire Trellorean continent.
BLINK! BLINK!...and now all the lands of Medievia.  You are stunned as you
realize this small spherical room is in the center of the known universe.
You don't understand however, what holds the place together, what strengthens
its walls and balances the great forces that must be pressing down on the
room from all angles, until you read a plaque placed on the wall.

plaque~
Once long ago, two great powers came together.  The first came to be
known as Cosmo, an ancient hero from Medievia's glorious past.  The
second was known as Ame, a fierce and wonderful woman who's beauty
was great in both body and soul.  They met one day near here, and
began travelling together, fighting side by side.  Many wonderful
days were spent in the mystical forest and soon they fell into a deep
love for each other that transcended this small world and filled thier
hearts with passion.  But soon a rumble came throughout the land,
disturbing their happy lives, bringing change and instability to their
world. So they came together and formed this small room, in hopes that
their love for each other could keep Medievia in balance and give them
a place of solace from the coming storms.  Herein lies the story of
this room and their love.  Feel welcome here my friends.

The Crystal Blue Ocean~
The light reflecting off the cool water's surface causes you to squint
slightly as you pass along the surface of the ocean. As far as you can
see to the east, the ocean continues interminably. Cliffs golden-white
with sand lie to the west.
