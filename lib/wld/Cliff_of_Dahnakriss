A Sloped Embankment~
This area of the cave is about twenty feet wide, with steeply inclined
walls to the east and west.  The "floor" you are straining to cling to
is so greatly slanted down to the south, that you're not sure if it
is the cavern floor, or the remains of a wall.

Base of a Stone Bridge~
The northern wall of this chamber rises up into darkness.  It also
extends to the east and west as far as your sight can penetrate the
darkness. There are no walls to the south, east or west, leaving
you in a huge cavernous chamber.  The ground to the south forms a
stone bridge of very fine craftsmanship.

An Oily Passage~
The cavern is fairly narrow here, with rocky protrusions jutting from
the walls and ceiling. The sound of running water echos loudly
throughout the cave.  The footing here is treacherous.  Oil drips
from the walls and runs down, forming shallow pools all over the
floor. A large opening lies in the center of the floor at the end
of this tunnel.

This cavern twists and winds in the darkness.  Jagged protrusions

thick and musty, filled with a light mist.  The tunnel is coated

You stand on a ten foot wide bridge of finished stone work. It

border the bridge walkway on the east and west side. Nothing but
empty, black space can be seen all around you. The sound of
rushing water echos loudly throughout the chamber.

You are in a large, circular cavern with walls rising up nearly seventy
feet into the darkness above.  The floor is covered by patches of
dried marsh grass and large leaves.  Cracked and gnawed bones litter
the cave floor.  A hole pierces the north wall of this cave.

A section of the floor slants down, forming a ramp down into the

the floor level.  The water is fairly clear, and you judge that it
is probably safe to drink from.  Mounted into the north wall, just
at the water's surface, is a rusted iron grate.  The grate allows
excess water to spill into it, disappearing into the darkness beyond.
You can hear running water splashing from the darkness, but the grate
is too secure to remove.

the water surface, there are two large holes in the walls, nearly
ten feet in diameter.  One is on the south wall, and the other on the
west. Water rushes out of the southern hole with tremendous force,
creating a waterfall that can be heard echoing throughout the entire
cavern. A small cascade of water trickles from the west hole.  There
appear to be enough hand-holds to reach the western hole.

Hovering Before a Cliff Face~
You are floating approximately ten feet about a narrow ledge jutting
from the face of the cliff.  An icy wind blows, sending a painful chill
through your entire body.  The ice-covered rock of the mountain is a
few feet in front of you, but there is little to hold onto at this
point. A few feet above you appears to be another ledge.

You carefully make your way along this icy cliff path.  The cold wind
blows, sending a painful chill through your body.  A thundering
waterfall to the west sprays the area with a light mist, causing ice
to form on the surfaces of the rock.

Another trail along the cliff face is twenty feet below you.  There
are a few hand and foot holds, but you would have to fall about half
the distance.  You judge you could safely make it down to the path,
but could never climb back up this way.

A Dark Passageway~
Just ahead of you, five large reptile skulls hang mysteriously in
midair.  The walls here appear to have been carved by a skilled
craftsman.  There are no seams or marks in the stone.  Clawed foot
prints mark the floor to the east of the hanging skulls, leading
down the tunnel into darkness.

Upon closer inspection of the skulls, you recognize them as hydra
skulls.  You can now see that strong threads from the ceiling hold
the skulls, making it appear as though they hang in mid air.

A Tunnel Branch~
The walls here are slimy and cold.  The floor and ceiling are in much
worse condition than the walls.  They have begun to crumble and crack.
The main passage continues to the east and west while another tunnel
branches off to the north.

A Dark Passageway~
You are in a ten foot wide corridor carved from the natural stone of
the mountain.  The floor is slick with water and oil.  The echoing
of droplets of water landing in pools fills the area.  A wooden door
stands at the far end of the tunnel.  Long claw marks mar the door's
surface. The scratches start about 5 feet up the door and run all
the way to the ground.

A Cavernous Intersection~
The smoothly carved tunnel from the west ends here.  The walls, floor
and ceiling appear to be natural.  The cavern is rough and jagged in
many places.  The floor is covered with a damp, thick clay.  The
echoing screaches of a cave-dwelling monster set your heart pounding.

The tunnel floor here is completely covered with thick, gooey oil.
It is ankle deep and makes walking extremely difficult.  The
cave turns here, leading to the north and east.  Strange clicking
noises echo down the hallway from the east.
