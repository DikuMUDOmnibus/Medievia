On the Island~
As you pull yourself up from the river, you find yourself on a fascinating
island.  Trees and rocks line the shore and watch the river lazily meander by.
Ahead in the distance you see a mist shrouded mountain, which seems strangely
large for such a dainty island.  Perhaps there is magic in the air.

A Quiet Glade~
You are in the midst of a quiet, moonlit glade.  The trees line the shore
of the river and shield this glade from outsiders.  To the northeast you can
see the huge mountain rising out of the mists, appearing as a giant guardiang
of peace in this tranquil setting.  Beneath a large willow, a large blanket
has been set out.  A basket sits beside it, as well as a bucket containing a
bottle of champagne.  A gilded candleabra sheds a warm glow over the blanket,
making you feel very relaxed and comfortable.

A dark wood door engraved with a detailed picture of a beautiful
wood faerie. Her delicate, translucent wings curl gently around
her naked body. Her hair hangs low to the ground, wrapping itself
around the flowers and ferns. Around her waist is a necklace of
red berries and on her forehead is a blue crescent moon.

The end of the rainbow~
You have reached the end of the rainbow.  Vibrant colors surround you in a
concealed glade.  The air is thick with magical energy, and you feel quite
refreshed as the energy flows through you.
Through the haze of swirling colors, you can see a large expanse of marble;
made up of alternating black and white squares.

Walking on the rainbow~
You stand in midair, supported by the magical bridge.  Color washes over your
feet and legs, swirling up and tickling your nose playfully.  Below you lies
the end of the rainbow.

As you climb up the magical rainbow, you feel as if you are nearly flying.
Each step takes you several hundred feet in the air, but a protective aura
surrounds you and prevents you from falling to your death.

Rocky ledge~
This ledge seems much safer than floating in the mist.  The waterfall has
created a huge rainbow here, dazzling you with the vibrant, magical colors.
Funny, but you almost think you could walk on the rainbow... nah... couldn't
be possible, hmm... I wonder....

This is a small, winding trail that leads up the mountain.  The mist is
beginning to thin, and you can just make out a large waterfall cascading
down the face of the mountain.

Trail up the mountain~
You have passed above the mist, and can now see the mountain clearly.  It
looks entirely too large to fit on the island, but it is there nonetheless.
You see several birds flying above, and can see the waterfall as it plummets
into a deep crevass below.

You are near the summit of the mountain now... the roaring of the waterfall

as if they are giant versions of normal birds of prey.

At the waterfall~
You stand beside the waterfall, a deafening roar now, watching as countless
tons of water pour over the edge and plummet to the base of the mountain.
Perhaps it it the spray from this waterfall that causes the mist at the base
of the island.

Over the waterfall~
You are falling rapidly towards the ground, having been swept away by the
powerful current of the water.  You mutter silent prayers to all the gods,
hoping that one will hear you and rescue you from certain death.

Atop the mist~
You are floating around in the mist that surrounds the base of this magestic
waterfall.  As you look below you, you find that you are barely above the
torrent of water, saved at the last possible instant from death.  Perhaps
your prayers were heard after all.

The nest~
You have climbed into a large nest.  Logs the size of your thigh make up most
of the framework, with bear, elk, and wolf pelts stuffed into the cracks.
A large pile of bones is the only sign of occupation, but from the looks of
them you do not want to be around here when the owner is hungry.  As you look
around, you notice a second peak, much higher than this one.  There appears to
be no path to it, but there is a small cabin built on it.  I wonder who built it?

Boudouir~
You step inside a large, comfortable bedroom. You are immediately welcomed by
the scent of sweet smelling herbs and incense. Against the far wall a huge
canopy bed with carved wooden posts and white gauze drapes beckons you to lay
your body down on it's soft, purple velvet bedspread. A fireplace sets against
the opposite wall, crackling softly and warming your skin. Standing in the
center of the room is a shiny black upright piano resonating softly in your ear
with each beautiful note. In the corner stands a divine statue of the goddess
Venus, her long beautiful hair flowing and curling down her naked body. All
around her are beautiful, exotic flowers that you have never seen before. In
front of her steam arises in gentle clouds, scented with freshly picked rose
petals from the hot tub. On the wall behind the bed you notice a few strange
looking hooks attatched with long strips of black silk...

The Kitty's Room~
 You can't help but smile when you walk into this room as warm rays of sunshine
beam through the skylight to bath your body in warmth and glow. Filling more
than half the room is a huge lavander velvet couch pit covered with soft, silk
white pillows. Your feet sink into soft, handwoven rugs scattered over the
floor. A warm fireplace glows softly, with a soft rug set near it to stretch
your body lazily in front of the warmth. Across from the couch is a playful
picture of the god and the goddess entwined together amongst a field of wild
flowers. Just as you sit down on the couch soaking up the sun rays your hear a
loud purring from behind you...
