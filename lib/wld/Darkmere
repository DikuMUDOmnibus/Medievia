magnificent chandelier hangs down in the middle of the room, it is made of
gold and studded with rubies. A few cobwebs cling to the top of the chain.

A cozy sitting room~
This is a fairly large, yet cozy room.  The walls are made to resemble logs
and the floor is polished hardwood.  A few large skins of black bears have
been places around the room, giving it a warmer feel.  There are two love
seat couches facing each other in the center of the room with a small table
in between them.  Two chairs face the fireplace built into the northern wall.
Several small mahogony tables and plush comfortable chairs are placed in
various positions about the room.

A library and study~
Bookshelves line the north, west and east walls of this room from floor
to ceiling. The shelves are filled with hundreds of books, all bound
in night-blue bindings, except for the north bookcase. Its books are bound
in midnight black covers with delicate silver runes adorning the bindings.
A huge black stone table sits against the south wall, its surface
is polished and glassy smooth. A high backed leather chair is pushed
in under the table. A window sits just above the table's surface and
provides a view of the grassy yard and surrounding forest outside.

You've left me with nothing left but questions
You left me here not knowing who I am
You've left me so much fucking time to hate you
You left me with no choice but to die
Violent Mood Swings...
Your voice whispers nearly all the time now
Reminding me just how worthless I am
Sometimes I just hear you laugh forever
I want you the fuck out of my head
Violent Mood Swings...
You're inside my pain inside my sorrow
I die for one last moment inside you
I miss you so fucking bad I am you
Whose god will fucking save me now
Violent Mood Swings...

The Coffin Chamber of the Shalafi~
You find yourself in a cold stone chamber, filled with musty air.  A large,
circular pit stands in the center of the room.  Stairs surround it, slowly
decending toward the center.  A sarcaphogus made of black, rough hewn stone
is mounted ominously in the center of the northern wall.  Several tapestries
with intricate stitchwork hang from the walls, each illuminated by a magical
light. An altar carved from black marble streaked with luminescent veins
of crimson stands between the fire pit and the coffin.  In the northeastern
corner hovers a magical portal of swirling silver mist and light.

A Balcony~
You are standing on a balcony outside the master bedroom. It is all made of
stone and connected seamlessly to the castle wall. The balcony is rather
large, about fifteen feet wide and ten feet deep. It is surrounded by a
waist high railing with intricately carved rails in the likeness of giant
fangs; making the whole balcony resemble a creatures jaw. Looking over the
railing you see a great ocean, the waves crashing against the rocks at
the base of the cliff which this castle is built on. The cool night
air blowing off the ocean soothes your mind and the blood red moon overhead
empowers your body and soul.
A stone tablet has been attached to the railing, with ancient script carved
into its surface.

tablet stone script~
:       :       Alone       :       :
From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were--I have not seen
As others saw--I could not bring
My passions from a common spring--
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow--I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone--
And all I loved--I loved alone--
Then--in my childhood, in the dawn
Of a most stormy life--was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still--
From the torrent, or the fountain--
From the red cliff of the mountain--
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold--
From the lightning in the sky
As it pass'd me flying by--
From the thunder and the storm--
And the cloud that took the form
When the rest of Heaven was blue
Of a demon in my view.

A yard before the castle~
The trail from the south has opened up into a grassy yard, surrounded by
a black, wrought iron fence.  At the north end of the yard, a few steps
lead up to the front doors of a large, ominous castle.  A single tower
juts up into the night sky.  Candle light flickers in most of the windows.

You are in a richly decorated bedroom. The floor is covered by a thick carpet.
There is a bed made of polished wood with high posts at the head and foot.
Against one wall is a large set of drawers and above it is a mirror frame
of platinum with intricate carvings, however the mirror itself seems to be
missing. At the foot of the bed is a large cedar chest with a full moon
carved into its lid. Next to the door is a small padded bench and a few hooks
in the wall to hang a cloak or coat.

A narrow trail through the woods~
You are walking on a narrow trail, covered with loose stones and pieces
of rock.  The trees and plants on either side of the path are very dense.
The trail seems to open up to the north and you catch a glimse of a castle
through the tree branches.  A strange fog surrounds you, limiting your
vision and dark clounds now fill the sky.  A small opening in their thick
oppressive cover is occupied by the full moon, blood red in color.
A shimmering moongate, the color of blood, stands at the south end of the
path.

made of exquisite black satin covers the delicate elven wood with which the
table was made.

The Master Bedroom~
You are in a large chamber with high vaulted cailings. The walls, ceiling
and floor are all made of stone. The roof slants up on each side to form
a triangular shape; near the top of the point on the south wall is a small
circular window through which you can see a blood red full moon. A long
chain attached to the ceiling supports a chandelier, glowing brightly with
many black candles. An enormous bed sits against the southern wall, raised
up on a marble dais. A fireplace, almost fifteen feet wide, occupies the
southwest corner; within it's depths, a fire blazes strongly. A comfortable
cushy couch faces the fireplace with a soft, shag rug on the floor between
the two. Small highly detailed candle sconces line the walls at shoulder
height, casting a soft glow over the whole room.

Unlike the rest of the chambers, this area is bathed with the warm glow
of many long black candles. In the center of the area is a large marble
bath big enough to fit two. The walls are covered with beautiful vines
and other green foliage thriving from the steam and the gentle moonlight
that fills the room as 3 walls and ceiling are curving glass overlooking
a flourishing flower and tree garden spreading out away from the grounds.
The bath is always filled with hot scented water flowing from a sculpture
of a dragon with wings spread wide in glorious detail. You hear the gentle
sounds of the night and the soft sound of pouring water, candles flutter and
are surrounded by a haze from the steam. Some brushes, towels and soap rest
on a small table along with some fresh fruit.
