bottles  contain pleasant smelling colognes.

Alchemy Lab~
This is one of the most cluttered rooms you can remember seeing.  Rows
upon rows of books line the walls, and you can only guess at how many
of these are spellbooks containing rare and arcane formulae.  Many
tables are in the room with various potions and mixtures and various
tools for mixing such things cluttering the tables.  Some of the potions
seems to be marked, perhaps there is something of value to be found.

Filling up this part of the hall is a huge dining table.  About forty
chairs are lined up around the table, yet it looks like it could seat
many more than forty guests.  You can picture all the wonderful food
being placed on the table and wonder if you'll ever have the honour
of eating in a place such as this.

and various different items that a castle might need at any time.  Perhaps
you should have a better look around, there could very well be something
of value within this room.

The Guards Tower~
Many guards mill arround this small tower.  All of the guards seem very
alert and seem to know whats going on.  One of the guards approaches you
and requests to take a look through your bags and pockets.  Knowing that
not cooperating will only bring your doom, you hand over your belongings.

From within this tower you can look through one of the many arrow slits
and see down upon the entire town.  You can even see as far as
the castles walls, and understand why this is such a great vantage
point.

Swimming around in this water, you can't see a thing around you.  The

As you enter this room you're overcome by a sense of well-being.  In each
corner of the room you see a flickering torch, shedding a soft light all

of the room.  A quill and papyrus are also on the desk.  The seem to be
important, perhaps you should have a look?

lands.

water seems to have grown almost unnaturally murky.  Off to you side
you hear a loud splash and wonder if its safe just swimming around here.

A Tabernacle~
This area is obviously a church.  There is a massive altar against the
center of the south wall.  Midway between the altar and the other three
walls, the room is divided on three sides by massive floor to ceiling
columns.  It is lit by two huge braziers, which burn with a flickering
purple flame, even though no fuel is visible, and they appear to give
off no heat.The room is huge, and there appear to be no exits other than
the doorway behind you.

racked next to them everything looks to be in its place.  There is a counter
a few feet into the shop, and as you approach, the weaponsmith, Alar,
bids you g'day.

As you enter this shop, you see a large counter spanning from wall to wall
at the far end of the shop.  Behind the counter, an old man is apparently
sorting out inventory.  All around you, there are shelves with all sorts of
items stacked upon them.  Against one wall you see a shelf full of all
the foodstuffs you might ever need, and against the other you see
miscellaneous items stacked.

opposite the bed, and a small table has been placed in front of the hearth.

There is a fireplace on the west wall and a muted yellow flame burns in
the hearth.  Although you can sense no fuel or smoke, the fire seems to
give off a pleasant warmth that is more than welcome.

As you enter this room, the sweet smell of alcohol floats to your nose.
The room is very dimly lit.  There are two large tables in the middle of
the room.  Sitting on each of the tables is a small candle, which is
apparently the only source of light in the room.  Theres a parchment
laid on each table, but you can not see what is on it.  Built into
the walls are small cubby halls, which on closer inspection are actually
huge wine racks.

This, like most of the other streets in town, is a wide, dirt path.  Wagon
tracks and footsteps are everywhere, although no dust can be seen and you
never seem to get any dirt in your eyes, as you would have expected.
There are less people on this road, as mainly houses line the road, and not 
shops.

Joske Way~
This, like most of the other streets in town, is a wide, dirt path.  Wagon
tracks and footsteps are everywhere, although no dust can be seen and you
never seem to get any dirt in your eyes, as you would have expected.
There are less people on this road, as mainly houses line the road, and not 
shops.

Potter's Workshop~
As you enter this shop, you're overcome by the smell of the clay.  In
the back of the room you can see what appears to be an apprentice,
trying to learn the knack of the wheel.  Along the walls, tables are
lined up.  Upon the table sits many works of art all shaped from clay.
As you enter, the Belkram walks up to you and asks how he may help you.

Kostil's Chambers~
This is a calm and quiet home.  There is a bed, a desk and two chairs grouped
around the empty fireplace, all of which seem to have been made of fine
materials.  Whoever lives here has very rich taste.

Guardians of Gilgamesh~
This is apparently a training room of some sort.  Shields and Swords line
the walls.  In the center of the room appears to be a small arena.
Two people are combatting in the arena, but it appears as if the older
appearing warrior is training the younger.

Taernil's Relaxation Rooms~
A massive four-poster bed dominates this high-ceilinged room.  The bed
must be nearltwenty feet wide and more than ten feet deep.  The dark,
carved wood posts attest to being a work of art.  The rest of the
are a desk, wardrobe and chest.  A massive ceramic tub sits in one
corner of the room.  The tub is a yard wide and nearly three yards long.
Despite its size, the tub is dwarfed by ornate marble pillars that stand in
an "L" shape behind it.

Bheloris's Canticle~
This house is simply decorated.  A white quilt covers a narrow bed.  Near
it is a small nightstand filled with thick, white candles.  Rugs woven
with images of fantastic creatures cover most of the floor.  The most
striking feature of this room is an altar decorated in silver and bronze
designs: claws, fangs, beaks and eyes.  Beyond the altar is a massive
upright chest.

The Safekeep of the Archmage Khelben~
Though the furnishings are simple and are made out of wood, this room
belongs to someone of wealth.  The woven rug on the floor must be worth
hundreds of gold pieces.  A thick black quilt covers the bed, and the chest
at its foot appears to be of hand-carved ebony.  A small globe hangs just
inside the door, giving off light.  The walls are of natural stone, as if this
room was chiseled out of rock.   The light plays over the cracks and
crevices of the walls.

The Theatre~
As you step under the archway, and into this massive theatre, you are
startled.  From the outside, this theatre appears to be tiny, but now that
you are inside, you can clearly see that this is not the case.  Balconies
and seats ring the center stage.  On the stage you can see a set, apparently
the one used for the last production put on here.

Ten beds line the walls in this room.  On the far wall you can see
Darnell's Coat of Arms.  A shield with a dragon engraved on it, held up
by a pegasus and a unicorn.  As you enter, three guards whirl on  you,
startled by your sudden entrance.

As you approach the castles gates, you feel a little humbled by the height
of the gates.  Several guards are standing watch in front of the gates,
one or two seem to be dealing with other travellers that have ventured
to this grand castle.

Upon the Battlements~
Looking down from the battlements, you see endless forests.  Far in the
distance you think you can make out a town, but you can't be sure.

Upon the Battlements~
Looking down from the battlements, you see endless forests.  Far in the
distance you think you can make out a town, but you can't be sure.
Suddenly, down below you hear a scurrying, peering down you see that its
only a deer, and you breathe a sigh of relief.

The Path Before the Castle~
This wide, cobblestone path leads up to the castle gates.  As you get closer
to the gates, you pull out a few coins and prepare to talk with the guards.
You hope to get through this quickly and without much trouble.

Guards Barracks~
This room seems to be some sort of rest room for the guards on watch duty.
Six comfortable wooden chairs surround a wooden table.  Two guards are
sitting at the table, whispering to each other.

A Small Hut~
This is a very small hut, apparently only built to fit two people.  There
is only one room, as far as you can see.  In the center of the room is
a small wooden table, and an uncomfortable looking wooden chair. On
top of the table is a rectangular mirror, but looking within it, you
see not your reflection, but a group of travellers in another town.
In the corner of the room, you see a small chest with a heavy, metal
lock on it.

The Baths~
You can see very little in this room but clouds of fog, far denser than the
mist which seems to permeate every inch of these corridors.  The room is
pleaasantly warm and steamy, and you can smell water.  Judging by the
echoes of your footsteps, this room is quite large.

Tristan's Bedroom~
This seems to be a childs room.  A small bed sits against one wall of the
room, against the opposite room is a nice oaken desk.  Upon the desk
is a set of quill and ink and a large sheaf of paper.  Upon the paper
you can see what looks like a small essay written by the occupant
of the room.

Papyrus~
Lord Byram;
It would seem that an army of orcs is advancing upon our region.  A few
of my scouts have reported large numbers of orcs and what seems to be
war camps being left in their mists.  It is my suggestion that we band
together to stop this heinous "army" from bringing war upon our lands.
Therefore, I hereby request your attendance at suppor on the full moon
hence a fortnight.
My Gratitude,
Lord and Barren, Darnell
