A Dark Path in the Forest~
The blackened pine trees that surround this path sway gently in the breeze.
Seasons have no meaning this deep in the forest, the branches have woven
together to form a canopy against the light of day, turning the forest into
a world of shadows. Who knows what is lurking just beyond the next turn in
the path...

A Gravel Road in the Forest~
   What was once only a small path through the forest, has turned into a small
gravel road. Although it hasn't been used too often someone, or something,
has been through here fairly recently. The road is also in fairly good
condition possibly indicating the presence of civilization nearby.

A Cobblestone Road~
   The path has finally solidified into what you would call an honest road.
It is made of Cobblestone and is in perfect condition, as if someone has
been diligently working to keep it in shape for some reason. Still a road
such as this would never be out in the middle of a forest! There must be
some sort of city nearby that is taking care of its upkeep. Hmmm would a
community as isolated as this be friendly to visitors? Or perhaps they just
might decide to have you for dinner, literally!

The Towne Gate~
The road has finally reached an end at a small wrought iron gate. The gate
is set into a small stone wall that surrounds a small town. It certainly
looks peaceful and normal enough, the houses are made of brick, and there
is the mouth watering smell of ribs being cooked over an open fire in the air.
The people don't look at all suprized to see visitors at their front gate,
which is probably only used to keep the animals at bay. Looks like a nice
towne to relax and toss down a few cold ones in, in your opinion.  You can
once again see the sky, bright blue and sun shining.  There doesn't seem to
be a cloud in sight.

Entrance to Towne~
   This is a small towne, but none the less it has been kept in good repair by
its inhabitants. The houses are whitewashed with painted shutters to keep the
weather at bay. The streets are clean and well maintained. Off in the distance
you can see an old castle that has fallen into disrepair. That's the only thing
that diminishes the beauty of this small towne, and even that only servers to
give the towne a rustic appearance.

A Small Guardpost~
   This is a small house used by the gatekeeper. Someone must stand by the
gate at night, just in case any weary travelers need to find shelter in the
town for the evening. Furniture is almost non-existent, there is only a small
bed and a table. The coals in the fireplace are still warm, however, so maybe
the occupant will return to greet you soon.

Madam Zash's~
   Everyone wants to know the future, and these people are no different. Madam
Zash specializes in the future. She predicts the future for these poor
farmers, when it will rain, when there will be a drought, etc. Everything a
fortune teller needs can be found somewhere in this cluttered room, crystal
ball, tarot cards, dice even a few animal bones and cow blood. Maybe its all a
hoax, but then again, maybe its not....

The Towne Fountain~
   This is where the hamlet gets most, if not all, their water. A large pool
of water is here. It's keep in constant motion somehow, bubbling up from the
depths and then back down a drain. People are busy filling bottles, pails, and
buckets with the crystal clear liquid. There is even a small area for the
women of the towne to wash clothes and children.

   Houses line this obviously residential street. The houses are larger than
some of the others you have seen, possibly indicating that you are in a more
affluent part of towne. Flowers and small trees continue to line the street
here and many of the houses have small flower beds in front of them.

The Towne Square~
   This would be the geographic center of the hamlet. Not as crowded as the
fountain square, this area is used to relax and chat among members of the town.
Several families have set out picnic blankets to rest here under the warmth of
the afternoon sun. A small residential street runs north and south of here.

Entrance to the Graveyard~
   You stand before the ancient gates to the hamlet's graveyard. This towne
is quite civilized when it comes to dealing with their dead, burning them
rather than burning them or sending them out to sea like some other cultures.
The graveyard is neat and clean, not like some graveyard out of a nightmare.

   This is a rather large, yet cozy house. Thick carpets that line the floors
and a large fireplace keep the house warm, so warm you almost wish to take off

perhaps you should leave the residents of the house alone.

you can rest and enjoy the beauty of the hamlet. The citizens use this street
to rest and relax after a hard days work in the fields.

   The Goodwife of this house has been busy cooking and cleaning the day away.
The wonderful smell of roast pork hangs heavy in the air along with various
spices and herbs. The house is impeccably neat, not a trace of dust can be
found anywhere in the entire house. If you did find some undated corner, the
goodwife would, no doubt, apologize for her lapse and spend the entire day
searching for any more she might have missed.

task with all the small carvings. The church is small, but in some ways more
beautiful than the largest cathedral!

Perhaps someone 'borrowed' something without asking the owners permission, or
accidentally slaughtered their neighbors cow. Whatever the problem, disputes are
brought to the towne constable, brought here to be settled.

   Heat from the forges makes this the hottest house you've been in. The
blacksmith apparently converted an old barn into the large room he uses as his
forge. A large bed has been placed in what used to be the hay loft, or so it
seems. The smell of horses from the nearby stables is overpowering, how anyone
could live with a smell like that who knows!

to be slaughtered can be heard off to the west. Any possible part of the cow
that can be used will be found in this store. And if they don't have what you
are looking for handy they're more than willing to go to the slaughter house
and cut you some for a small extra fee.

A Cull-de-sac~
   This is where the few businesses of the hamlet are located. The town
doesn't need much so there are very few shops in town, what the people need
they usually make. There is however a small butcher shop to the north of here
that seems to turn a pretty penny. There are houses east and west of here that
seem to be quite nice compared to some of the poorer houses in the east.

A Quiet Courtyard~
   Two houses and a horse stable surround this small courtyard. This isn't one
of the more popular places in towne due to the powerful odor that comes from
the horse stable to the south. Im sure if you had to live in this section of
town you could get used to the odor and the noise of the horses, some people
apparently have judging by the houses here.

typical stable, small stalls to keep the horses in when they're not running
around, buckets of water and oats, and of course various riding gear. You cant
stop this strange feeling, however, that someone (or something) is watching
you from the shadows.

A Destroyed House~
   A large fire has destroyed this once beautiful house. As you enter its
remains a strong wind picks up, and the sky begins to darken as if to rain.
Suddenly there is a shimmering in the air and an image appears before you!
   The phantom image begins to speak....
   "They said i talked with wolves, the dark ones creatures...."
   "They burned me alive and called me Darkfriend...."
   "But from hell's heart i stab at them...I curse them all....They shall know
wolves like no one else in the world....And wish they had been kinder to an
old woman.....A lonely woman...."
   The phantom returns to the mists which gave it life, but the darkness
remains, night has fallen on this small town, perhaps to stay....

covering the walls or tables.

The Slaughter House~
   Freshly slaughtered cattle lie here in heaps. This is certainly not the
cleanest place in the world (the FDA would not approve). Bones and waste
material has been discarded on the floor without regards to a persons health.
Maybe you should tell someone about the rancid meat that is laying around,
course the dogs seem to like it...

Beyond the gate is a small road that apparently leads to a castle off in the

if some presence is watching you from there... Its strange that these
villagers would not keep this place in as good repair as the rest of their
towne, perhaps you should ask someone about it.

horses, but someone or something, seems to have used it recently...

are of a pinkish hue, and the quilt that covers the bed is decorated with
flowers. It almost makes you sick that any room could be this sweet, imagine

Deep puddles in the limestone and a wealth of sand tell you that at high tide
this place will be underwater, take care that your are not in here when that
happens! A strong wind seems to come out of nowhere, whipping through the
natural features of the cave, it almost sounds like a moan.

a month in here would be far worse than a year in Trellor's jail.

completeness surround this room, and sawdust is Everywhere! You can't imagine
how the goodwife manages to keep all the sawdust out of the rest of the house,
it is certainly a credit to her cleaning skills.

On The Second Floor~
The stairs have led you up to the second floor of the inn and a small
hallway. Small compared to some of the nicer hotels of Medievia, this inn
only has 4 rooms, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in comfort. plush
carpet lines the floors and beautiful pictures cover the walls. Staying in a
place like this certainly wouldn't be the worst thing you could do.

A Bedchamber~
   This small room has two beds for its occupants to sleep should they grow
weary. A comfortable chair is positioned by the fireplace to relax at the end
of a long day of adventuring. To bad the room wasn't a single, you could use a
good nap.

A Private Room~
   This room is especially made up for only one person, a rarity for most
hotels. The bed is turned down, as it appears this room is already rented to
someone ... someone who is not you! Certainly they would be upset if they
found you in their personal things, but then again maybe they wouldn't notice
if you took a quick nap.

A Small Hallway~
   The last of the rooms are here at the end of the hallway. This is the
quietest place in the whole inn, these rooms must fetch a special price. Even
the doors are intricately carved from what appears to be, one single piece of
wood.

A Tiny Room~
   This room was obviously not designed to be lived in, in the original plans
that is. The owner of the inn has apparently converted some storage space into
a room in order to serve more people. Strange though, not many people should
be coming through a towne such as this. Perhaps in days of old there was
something in to the town to draw visitors from the outside world...

The Choir Loft~
   Even the small churches like to separate the choir from the parishioners.
The music from the small quartet and a few choir members is all a small church
like this needs to be filled with harmony. Even without their playing at the
moment, you can imagine how beautiful it must sound.

The Church Steeple~
   A small winding staircase leads you up above the choir loft and the pews of
the church. Few people bother going up here, dust has even started to
accumulate in a few corners. Above you, you can make out the outlines of a
small trapdoor, possibly leading to the bell tower.

The Bell Tower~
   Large brass bells fill most of the space in here. These bells probably
serve as an important means of communication for the towne, signaling time to
worship, time to wake, and a call to order if need be. Of course, is they were
Rung while you were up here....
BOOONNNNNNGGGGGGG BOOOOONNNNNGGGGG BOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGG
ACK! you are deafened by the noise.

A Basement~
   A set of old, mildewy steps leads you down into the Basement of the house.
Here is where the house's goodwife stores her preserves for the long winter. A
sweet sent from all the food hangs in the air, however it is not enough to
fend off the damp dank smells of the basement. Its dark down here, and the
shadows seem to be watching you...

The Rootcellar~
   As in some of the other houses in the hamlet, this house has a small cellar
to store food throughout the winter. By the looks of things, this house will
never go hungry no matter how long the winter lasts! Rows upon rows of
pickling jars line shelves that seem to go on forever. There must be enough
here to feed half the village. Upon closer inspection you realize that
something is wrong with the jars.

jars shelves rows~
Well no cellar can be full all the time can it? The jars in every row are
filled, and there is a thick layer of dust on top. It seems as if the mayor
has not had to use this cellar in a long time, he must have some other way to
keep himself fed throughout the winter....

The Mayor's Office~
This is the small office from which the mayor handles all the formalities
of running this hamlet. An old, oaken desk is the centerpiece of the office,
and looks as good as a lord of Medievia's.  The mayor certainly enjoys the
benefits of office to their fullest extent.

The End of the Beach~
As you reach the end of the beach, something about the cliff makes you
shiver. As you get closer you realize that the cliff as been carved, just
enough to make is seem natural, but carved nonetheless. After careful study
you realize ... they're faces! Human faces staring out at the beautiful sea.
A set of stairs is here to take you up the cliff.

The Field~
   The horses of the town use this field to stretch their legs and feed. Large
mounds of hay dot the field for the horses to feed. The entire area is fenced
in so that the horses cannot run away into the forests beyond the towne. The
fences also serve to keep wild animals from feeding on the horses. This
particular part of the field seems particularly empty, perhaps the horses
don't like being so close to the graveyard....

The Towne Jail~
   A musty smell hangs in the air of this fowl place. Obviously, the hamlet
doesn't believe in locking people up very often, but when they do the offenders
are brought here to this decrepit dungeon. The only furnishing in this place is
a small wooden chair that a guard uses to rest while he watches his prisoners.

   This is where the butcher keeps the cows that he is about to slaughter.
Here the cows graze on the thick green grass with no concern that they are
about to die. By the way ... Id be careful where ya step, cows don't really
care about being the cleanest creatures on the planet and certainly don't use a
bathroom!
