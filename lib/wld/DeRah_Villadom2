A Gravel Road in the Forest~
The small forest path has become a small road, obviously there is some sort
of civilization nearby. A light mist obscures the ground making it impossible
to see your feet, this and the shadows from the trees make it quite a chilling
sight. A full moon can be seen in the night sky through the tree branches
overhead.

A Cobblestone Road~
   You are traveling upon an old cobblestone road much like you'd expect to
find near an abandoned town. Weeds have begun to grow between what's left of
the stones. The mist that once obscured the road has begun to fade away, but
an errie silence still hangs heavy over it. You'd swear its darker tonight
than most nights, even the full moon seems to give no illumination. You best
be careful tonight...

The Towne Gate~
   The road has ended at an old towne gate. The bars have begun to rust and
several have been bent, its as if some large beast tore through it. Beyond
lies a small towne. By the looks of it its a poor towne, several of the
buildings seem to have fallen down or are about to. The howl of a lone wolf in
the distance is the only sound to break the silence...

be seen anywhere, even the street lamps are dark. What could have caused so
many to leave so quickly?

It takes you a minute to realize that they are colored with someone's blood!
violence has taken place in this towne and not too long ago, that blood
couldn't be more than a few hours old.

Madam Zash's~
   Everyone wants to know the future, and these people are no different. Madam
Zash specializes in the future. She predicts the future for these poor
farmers, when it will rain, when there will be a drought, etc. Everything a
fortune teller needs can be found somewhere in this cluttered room, crystal
ball, tarot cards, dice even a few animal bones and cow blood. Maybe its all a
hoax, but then again, maybe its not....

A scene of utter horror greets you as you approach the fountain. Dried blood

be involved!

This house was once warm and comfortable. Two fireplaces kept the large

leaving just the frame, a burned out shell so to speak. A skeleton is all that
remains of the former occupant, his flesh burned off just like the paint that
once covered the walls.  You feel light headed as the smell of burnt flesh

some of the others you have seen, possibly indicating that you are in a more
affluent part of towne. Flowers used to line the street, now however there is
only dirt as the flowers have been pulled out long ago. Anything of beauty
seems to have been ripped forcibly from this towne.

The Towne Square~
   This is where the towne used to gather for important announcements and
meetings. Apparently whoever still lives here had a gathering recently, the
ground is trampled and burnt out torches litter the ground. Whatever the
meeting was about violence certainly had a part, fresh blood can still be
found in places and so can a few broken weapons, bloody of course.

Entrance to the Graveyard~
You stand before the ancient gates to the hamlet's graveyard. This towne
is quite civilized when it comes to dealing with their dead, burning them
rather than burning them or sending them out to sea like some other cultures.
The graveyard is dark and eerie, very much like something from a horrid
nightmare.

This house was once warm and comfortable. Two fireplaces kept the large
house quite warm, perhaps too warm. A large fire has burned most of the house,
leaving just the frame, a burned out shell so to speak. A blackened and burnt
corpse of the former occupant lays in the middle of the room.  Portions of
his flesh still burn with a small flame and the smell of his torched flesh fill

but they have been destroyed as has much of hamlet.  Smoke and terrifying
screams fill the night air.

leads to the upper floor.

Perhaps someone 'borrowed' something without asking the owners permission, or
accidentally slaughtered their neighbors cow. Whatever the problem, disputes are
brought to the towne constable, brought here to be settled.

   Heat from the forges makes this the hottest house you've been in. The
blacksmith apparently converted an old barn into the large room he uses as his
forge. A large bed has been placed in what used to be the hay loft, or so it
seems. The smell of horses from the nearby stables is overpowering, how anyone
could live with a smell like that who knows!

and cut you some for a small extra fee.

   This is where the few businesses of the hamlet are located. The town
doesn't need much so there are very few shops in town, what the people need
they usually make. There is however a small butcher shop to the north of here
that seems to turn a pretty penny. There are houses east and west of here that
seem to be quite nice compared to some of the poorer houses in the east.

This place is strangely quiet, even for a towne such as this. Something must
have kept most of the werecreatures away from this place as much as possible.
Perhaps they just finished destroying this part of town and moved on.
Certainly no business remains on this deserted street. However you can still

   A large fire has destroyed this once beautiful house. As you enter its

Suddenly there is a shimmering in the air and an image appears before you!
   The phantom image begins to speak....
   "They said i talked with wolves, the dark ones creatures...."
   "They burned me alive and called me Darkfriend...."
   "But from hell's heart i stab at them...I curse them all....They shall know
wolves like no one else in the world....And wish they had been kinder to an
old woman.....A lonely woman...."
   The phantom returns to the mists which gave it life, but the darkness
remains, night has fallen on this small town, perhaps to stay....

   Freshly slaughtered cattle lie here in heaps. This is certainly not the

material has been discarded on the floor without regards to a persons health.
Maybe you should tell someone about the rancid meat that is laying around,
course the dogs seem to like it...

villagers would not keep this place in as good repair as the rest of their

fit in, and the color scheme indicates that it is a child's room. The curtains
are of a pinkish hue, and the quilt that covers the bed is decorated with
flowers. It almost makes you sick that any room could be this sweet, imagine

Deep puddles in the limestone and a wealth of sand tell you that at high tide
this place will be underwater, take care that your are not in here when that
happens! A strong wind seems to come out of nowhere, whipping through the
natural features of the cave, it almost sounds like a moan.

a month in here would be far worse than a year in Trellor's jail.
Two chains are secured into the stone wall, broken off at the ends.

On The Second Floor~
The stairs have led you up to the second floor of the inn and a small
hallway. Small compared to some of the nicer hotels of Medievia, this inn
only has 4 rooms. The once thick carpet that covered the floors has been
ripper to shreds by what appears to animal's claws. Pictures have been
ripped off the wall, and blood smears are drying where they once hung.

A Bedchamber~
   This small room once had two beds for its occupants to sleep should they
grow weary. Now however the beds are overturned to provide cover should a
crossbow man barge in. The fireplace shows signs of a recent fire, but it was
kept small so as to avoid notice from the outside. Apparently someone, or
something, has been using this room as a shelter from the fighting.

A Private Room~
   This room was especially made up for only one person, a rarity for most
hotels.  The fighting has not spared this room however, the once beautiful bed
has been ripped to shreds, the furniture is now kindling, even some of the
floorboards have been ripped up!

A Small Hallway~
The last of the rooms are here at the end of the hallway. This is the
quietest place in the whole inn, these rooms must fetch a special price. Even
the doors are intricately carved from what appears to be, one single piece of
wood. Two sets of bloody bootprints enter the hall from the south, they
split and one enters each door.

A Tiny Room~
   This room was obviously not designed to be lived in, in the original plans
that is. The owner of the inn has apparently converted some storage space into
a room in order to serve more people. Strange though, not many people should
be coming through a towne such as this. Perhaps in days of old there was
something in to the town to draw visitors from the outside world...

The Choir Loft~
   Even the small churches like to separate the choir from the parishioners.
The music from the small quartet and a few choir members is all a small church
like this needs to be filled with harmony. Even without their playing at the
moment, you can imagine how beautiful it must sound.

The Church Steeple~
   A small winding staircase leads you up above the choir loft and the pews of
the church. Few people bother going up here, dust has even started to
accumulate in a few corners. Above you, you can make out the outlines of a
small trapdoor, possibly leading to the bell tower.

The Bell Tower~
Large brass bells fill most of the space in here. These bells probably
serve as an important means of communication for the towne, signaling time to
worship, time to wake, and a call to order if need be.  You cring in disgust
when you realize the bell clapper has been replaced with a mutilated body,
hanging by its feet upside down.

A Basement~
A set of old, mildewy steps leads you down into the basement of the house.
Here is where the house's goodwife used to store her preserves for the long
winter. It seems as if all the food went bad, the room reeks of decay and mold.
Whoever canned this stuff must not have know what they were doing, or perhaps
some supernatural force is at work in this hamlet. Its dark down here, and the
shadows seem to be watching you...

Inside A Grave~
   You climb down into a freshly dug grave (why you would ever do such a thing
is beyond me!). The dirt is freshly wet from the evening dew. Contrary to your
fears, nothing down here is moving, but a strange 'presence' seems to be
watching you. You begin to get a queasy feeling in your stomach as a thick
mist begins pouring in from above ...

The Rootcellar~
   As in some of the other houses in the hamlet, this house has a small cellar
to store food throughout the winter. By the looks of things, this house will
never go hungry no matter how long the winter lasts! Rows upon rows of
pickling jars line shelves that seem to go on forever. There must be enough
here to feed half the village. Upon closer inspection you realize that
something is wrong with the jars.

jars shelves rows~
   Well no cellar can be full all the time can it? The jars in ever row are
filled, and there is a thick layer of dust on top. It seems as if the mayor
has not had to use this cellar in a long time, he must have some other way to
keep himself fed throughout the winter....

The Mayor's Office~
   This is the small office from which the mayor handles all the formalities
of running this hamlet. An old, oaken desk is the centerpiece of the office,
and looks as good as the mayor of Middguaard's. The mayor certainly enjoys the
benefits of office to their fullest extent.

The End of the Beach~
As you reach the end of the beach, something about the cliff makes you
shiver. As you get closer you realize that the cliff as been carved, just
enough to make is seem natural, but carved nonetheless. After careful study
you realize... they're faces! Grotesque faces of a half-human, half-wolf
creature. A set of stairs is here to take you up the cliff.

The Field~
   The horses of the town use this field to stretch their legs and feed. Large
mounds of hay dot the field for the horses to feed. The entire area is fenced
in so that the horses cannot run away into the forests beyond the towne. The
fences also serve to keep wild animals from feeding on the horses. This
particular part of the field seems particularly empty, perhaps the horses
don't like being so close to the graveyard....

The Towne Jail~
   A musty smell hangs in the air of this fowl place. Obviously, the hamlet
doesn't believe in locking people up very often, but when they do the offenders
are brought here to this decrepit dungeon. The only furnishing in this place is
a small wooden chair that a guard uses to rest while he watches his prisoners.

The Pasture~
   This is where the butcher keeps the cows that he is about to slaughter.
Here the cows graze on the thick green grass with no concern that they are
about to die. By the way ... Id be careful where ya step, cows don't really
care about being the cleanest creatures on the planet and certainly don't use a
bathroom!

An Overgrown Garden~
   This looks more like some sort of jungle than a garden. Its as if the
plants haven't been taken care of for years! Weeds have sprouted out of the
walkways, plants have outgrown their pots, and at least one tree has grown
right through a window in this small courtyard.
