The iron staircase~
You gingerly descend the old, rusty, circular iron starcase. Some steps have
completely rusted through, and the whole structure sways dangerously with every
step you take. There's no railing, and your heart pounds as you think about
what may be waiting in the darkness below to feed on your shattered body.

Base of the iron staircase~
You breathe a sigh of relief as you step off of the old staircase. You're in a
small passage that's dimly illuminated by beams of light coming from the forest
above. The passage widens to the north, and narrows to the south. Although it's
too dark to see down, you have a sense that the north passage goes for a very
long distance. You also feel that something is moving out there in the
darkness...

The iron staircase~
Your desperation to escape the tunnel system makes you careless. Halfway up the
staircase, you forget to test a step before putting your weight on it. The
rusty step collapses, and with nothing to grab onto, you plummet off of the
edge of the staircase and into the blackness. The hard rock below smashes your
bones to fragments. As you pass out from the pain, you see grey crablike
creatures emerging from the shadows of the tunnel, ready to give proper welcome
to this unexpected meal.

A dead end~
It looks like this tunnel once went further south, but it has collapsed. A
solid wall of rock and dirt blocks all progress in that direction. The only
exit is north.

The long dark passage of terror~
You are consumed by fear as you enter this passage. The air around you is
thick, heavy, clutching at you. Your light seems dim and weak, as if it was
fighting the atmosphere of this place. The iron staircase to the south is like
a godsend, promising escape from this horrible place, and it takes all your
willpower not to run back to it immediately.

You puzzle over how the passage could have been formed. Even water would not

and you notice now that the floor is as smooth as the walls. Could the denizens
of these tunnels have some strange magic, capable of shaping rock itself? You
shiver at the thought.

Inside the great worm~
You step into a small, hot room with moist walls. A sticky fluid comes up to
your ankles, burning your feet as it seeps into your boots. Below the surface o
the fluid you can see the decayed remains of many creatures - even what looks
like a human skeleton! Suddenly afraid, you turn for the exit, when the room
around you heaves and a rock wall slides into place over the opening! You
realize, too late, that it was not the wall that moved, but the room. You've
stepped into the gut of some great creature, one that is now aware of you. The
walls contract, the "room" growing smaller. You scream horribly as they press
around you, crushing you, forcing you down into the burning digestive fluid...

A pit of slime~
The tunnel comes to an abrupt end here. The room is dominated by a pit, perhaps
five feet across, covered with thick, almost solid, yellowish slime. Strange
vines grow from the floor and walls here. They are a very pale green, almost
translucent. Within the vines you can see the skeletal remains of many small
creatures. The vines seem to be wrapped about the remains, as if feeding on
them in some way. You notice that the vines, although thick in most parts of
the room, never come very close to the slime pit. You wonder if there is any
importance to this.

slime~
The pit is like something out of a nightmare, crawling with little wriggly
things. Every so often the slime vibrates slightly, as if something below the
surface was moving. Or, perhaps the slime itself is alive somehow...

Inside the slime pit~
You blithely jump into the slime pit, unconcerned about any possible dangers.
Immediately your body is seized by agony. You lift your hand out of the muck,
and stare in horror as the flesh seems to melt away. The "slime" is a powerful
acid, used by the creature who lives in the pit to predigest its food. As you
struggle, a pale tentacle with blood-red capillaries rises up from the slime,
wrapping around you and dragging you down to meet your doom. It was so nice of
you to stop by for dinner...

A damp passage~
Beads of moisture are on the walls of this passage, shining as they reflect the
glow from your light source. The passage seems to get wetter to the north, and
to the south is a bend.

A damp passage~
You notice that the amount of water on the walls has increased. Looking
carefully, you see that it is seeping through tiny cracks in the ceiling,
collecting and running in thin rivulets down the walls. The passage continues
to the north and south.

A wet passage~
Streams of water run down the walls of the passage. There is an inch of water
on the floor, and you walk carefully to avoid slipping. Patches of green fungus

Under the swamp of Thanos~
The walls are wet with running water, which collects on the ground in wide
pools that you slosh through. Swamp water drips freely from the ceiling, making
soft plopping noises as it hits the pools. Patches of green and brown fungus
grow on the walls. You avert your eyes from the water, which is an unhealthy
shade of brown, and wrinkle your nose.

Beneath the swamp of Thanos~
This is a relatively dry passage, with only a few inches of water. It is a
blessed relief to hear the dripping sounds lessen, to feel cold swamp water run
down your arms less frequently. It does cross your mind, though, that there
might be some other creatures down here who also prefer this type of
environment...

There's much more water here. It rises up to your ankles, soaking your feet
inside their boots. The floor of the passage is barely visible beneath the
murky haze of swamp water. To the north is a loud watery roaring sound, not
unlike a waterfall.

A hole in the ceiling~
The water is up to your knees, and you shiver from its coldness. Above you is a
small hole in the ceiling, perhaps a foot wide. Water cascades down from the
hole with great force, splashing down, soaking you to the skin when you try to
pass it, and forming a fine mist. The swamp muck floating around in the mist
makes you want to sneeze. Through the hole above you can see the thick roots of
the mutated trees in the swamp. Above that, you think that you can see a faint
glow of light from the surface. The thought reminds you of just how far away
you are from the sunlight, and from other human beings.

Under the swamp of Thanos~
Both walls are wet with running water, which collects on the ground in wide
pools that you slosh through. Swamp water drips freely from the ceiling, making
soft plopping noises as it hits the pools. Patches of green and brown fungus
grow on the walls. You avert your eyes from the water, which is an unhealthy
shade of brown, and wrinkle your nose.

Beneath the swamp of Thanos~
This passage appears to be the low point of the local tunnel system. The water
rises high around you, at some points coming almost to your waist, and you feel
like you're swimming as much as walking. You sweep your weapon through the
water in front of you, wary of what may be lurking in it.

A clean passage~
You pull yourself up through the hole and find yourself in a passage leading
north. The walls are bare, in stark contrast to the room below you. The moss
looks almost...well, sheared off, at the edge of the hole. You wonder if there
is any significance to this.

fungi, or lichen. There is also no dirt and no loose pieces of rock. To the
north of you the tunnel bends to the west, to the south it leads back down into
the moss room.

A clean passage~
Directly to the west is a frightening sight. A skeleton seems to be suspended
in the air, immobile. Around it, also hanging in the air, are other things - a
sword, a chunk of rock, what looks like a bracer, and some objects that are too
small to see clearly. Your instincts warn you to turn back, right now. Dare you
go on?

This seems to be where the gelatinous cube dropped everything that it couldn't
digest. Some armor and weapons from previous luckless adventurers are here, but
the cube has turned them into junk. It doesn't look like there's anything of
value in this room. The only obvious exit is east.

A downward sloping tunnel~
A passage starts here, angling downward to the north. Water trickles from the
ceiling, running down the passage and out of sight. The floor is covered with
scum and looks slippery. You think you could keep your balance going down, but
you're not sure if you could get back up here again.

Below a metal chute~
The angle of the tunnel grows steeper, your descent more precarious, and you
struggle to keep your balance. Suddenly you step on a particularly slippery
patch of scum and your foot slides out from beneath you! You flail your arms
wildly, but it's a lost cause, and you're soon careening helplessly down the
tunnel, picking up speed, like a rider on a giant waterslide. The rock abruptly
changes to metal and you realize you're inside a metal chute, descending into
the unknown at frightening speed. A moment later the chute is gone from beneath
you, and you fall through the air to land on the ground in a heap. Picking
yourself up, you realize that you're in the center of a huge cavern. The lower
end of the chute is on the ceiling far above you, barely visible, and
completely out of reach. You stare out into the darkness, and you hear things
waiting for you...

Southeast corner of the genesis pit~
You feel like a bird in a cage, hiding in a corner while the cat slinks closer.
You hear noises out in the darkness, of monsters closing in on you, sealing off
your escape, thirsting for your warm blood.

You have the feeling that no one has used this tunnel in a very long time.
Dust and fallen rocks are everywhere, with no signs of any passage by another
being.

The Temple of Power~
You have arrived at a large room with a high domed ceiling. A large bright
globe, hovering a foot below the ceiling, illuminates the entire room. Directly
below the globe, set into the floor, is a perfect circular portal, as wide as a
man is tall. Thick mist comes out of the portal, rising in a plume to surround
the globe, which seems to draw it in and feed off of it. Cloaked, hooded
figures pace slowly around the portal, chanting in a forgotten tongue. The
chanting resonates with the rock walls, and the air about you hums with energy.
Occasionally there is a noise from the portal, a low rumbling groan, and the
ground seems to tense. But, always, the figures raise their voices for a moment
and the tension subsides. The scene is beyond your comprehension, and more than
a little disturbing. The figures ignore you as they continue their ritual.

portal~

This room is a stub, existing so that its title will appear if the exits
command is used in the room above. No one (except for gods) should be able to

A shrine to Thanos~
The tunnel ends here at a large circular room. The center of the room has been
hollowed out, and a huge blazing fire burns in the depression. Crude drawings
are on all the walls. The most prominent one shows hundreds of harginn kneeling
before a huge flaming humanoid figure. Several other drawings catch your eye as
well: a tangle of flaming vines...a handsome man...a towering column of flame.
It appears that this is a place of worship.

As you enter this section of the tunnel, the roof collapses onto you. The
constant fires have heated the rock ceiling, weakening it, and the noise caused
by your arrival is enough to set it loose. The falling rocks pound you down
before you can react, covering you with stone, a cairn for a fallen hero.

Falling into a pit of fire~
As you enter this room, you feel the floor vibrate ominously under your weight.
You dive for the wall, scrabbling for a handhold, but there are none to be
found. As you turn your head back and forth in panic, you have brief glimpses
of the thin floor collapsing, the deep pit revealed below, and the incredible
fires, as hot as Hell, that burn at the bottom. Then gravity takes hold of you,
and you plummet down into the inferno...

The fires are everywhere, almost hiding the north exit from view. You can
barely see with the bright light and smoke in your eyes. You walk farther into
the room, scanning for anything of importance, and inadvertently step too close
to one of the crevices. It lets loose a blast of flame, and suddenly you're on
fire! You bat at the flames, running for the exit, but with the light, smoke,
and your own panic, you miss it! You run madly about the room, the pain making
you less and less rational, bouncing off walls, being cooked alive within your
armor...

You have entered a wide room filled with leaping flames. The foul smell of

are scattered about the room; it appears that something lives (and eats) here.
On the west wall is a magical portal displaying a hideous scene. It bears
further examination.

portal wall~
You see a land of death and desolation, with a grey cracked plain spreading out
to the limits of sight. There is no sun and no sunlight, only a sickly ambient
light that fuzzes the outlines of everything. Literally thousands of humanoid
creatures wander the plain, wretched things with bloated white skin, long
claws, and sharp teeth. There seems to be an invisible barrier across the
portal that prevents any passage, and you decide that this is a good thing.

You crawl through the secret door, nimbly avoiding the flames, and find
yourself in a small vertical passage. Bracing feet against one wall and your
back against the other, you make slow progress down. Finally, you see an end to
the passage below you, and the floor a short distance farther. You doubt you
could make it back up the passage, so there's only one way to go - down!

line of slime, and a faint breeze drifts from the east.

A bottomless pit~
You step onto a seemingly normal section of tunnel, and your foot lands on thin
air! Off balance, and caught unaware, you topple forward and through the clever
illusion. Almost before you know it, you're falling down a dark pit, so wide
you cannot see the walls. The tunnel above recedes into the distance and is
gone. You fall for a long time, alone with the darkness and your fears. As each
second passes, you expect to hit bottom, but you never do. Days later, when you
finally die from thirst, your body is still falling endlessly through space.

You are surrounded by gale force winds. Miniature whirlwinds move through the

magical portal which seems to open on a cloudless sky. It is from this portal
that the intense winds are coming. It may bear further examination.

be an invisible barrier across the portal that prevents any physical passage,
but lets the wind through just fine.

across each other. The traces glow faintly with a white light. You try to touch
one and immediately feel a powerful energy that makes your hand tingle.

You stand in a perfect hemisphere, the walls seemingly made of solid silver.
Only by looking very closely can you see that the silver is not solid, but is
formed into a fine irregular mesh, miniature traces connecting to other traces
with no recognizable pattern. In places on the wall are small black rectangles,
attached to the traces by steel pins. The mesh glows brightly, filling the room
with intense white light. A strange smell, almost like paper, is in the air.

The walls and floor change here, shifting naturally from rock and dirt into
dark sapphire crystal. The sapphire has been hand-carved into intersecting
planes, giving you the feeling of walking on a gem that's been turned
inside-out. The tunnel continues to the east, where the smell of decaying flesh
becomes stronger.

You have arrived at the source of the smell. Human corpses have been stacked
neatly into piles tied up with electrum chains. On top of each pile rests a
single mandrake leaf. The bodies have a trace green glow that you recognize
from your own encounters with the necromancer. None of the bodies have been
dead for long; evidently they arrive and depart at regular intervals.

legendary Vault of Souls. Many beings, dead and alive, have passed through this
door. All have left as soulless husks, their vital essences captured by the
evil Keeper and imprisoned within the Vault.

You stand in the final resting place of Medievia's citizens. Racks upon racks
of sapphire bottles stretch off as far as the eye can see. Each bottle glows
faintly, a silent reminder of the helpless spirit trapped within. Set into the
floor near the entrance is a pentagram edged with electrum. It seems to be in
use at the moment; a corpse has been stretched out within it, and an empty
sapphire bottle lies nearby. Unfortunately for you, the Keeper prefers to work
without spectators...

You have entered a well-equipped medieval laboratory, which uses magic to
augment the often clumsy tools and devices. A whole wall of this room is filled
with cages containing all manner of strange and frightening creatures. In one
cage is a snapper with an extra pair of eyes. In another is a mosquito from the
swamp, but its wings have been amputated. They may be the pair of wings that's
on the lamia in the corner cage, but you're not sure. The monsters cry out as
you enter, attracting the attention of a sinister, animal-like girl working at
one of the tables.

Apparently the dumbwaiter is enchanted. When you crawl into it, it begins to
swiftly move upward on its own. You move up for what feels like several hundred
feet, until a hole appears in the wall. Suddenly the dumbwaiter tilts
violently, and you are thrown through the hole! You land on a steep metal
surface and immediately begin sliding downwards. Moments later you are flying
through thin air to land in a heap on the ground. A sinking feeling overtakes
you as you realize where you are. Well, Neifirst had to have SOME way to get
her monsters into the pit...

limply from strands of cartilage. Dry, yellowed skin is stretched between
cracked shoulder blades. Only one item is missing from the horrible assemblage:
a human skull.

At long last you stand before the master necromancer, Thanos. The room is a
temple to death, with human remains scattered everywhere. The floor is of
obsidian; the walls of dark malachite. A throne made of human skulls is in the
center of the room, supported by a pedestal built from arm and leg bones. From
this room Thanos controls his network of dark mages, drawing power from all the
deaths in the lands of Medievia.

writing song~
It appears to be a work, titled "The Song of the Swords", that describes twelve
Swords of Power created by the gods. It is written in an ancient script that
you have great difficulty making out. You are only able to read two of the
stanzas in full:
'Farslayer howls across the world
 For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
 Vengeance is his who casts the blade
 Yet he will in the end no triumph see.'
'Whose flesh the Sword of Mercy hurts has drawn no breath;
 Whose soul it heals has wandered in the night,
 Has paid the summing of all debts in death
 Has turned to see returning light.'
Time has blurred the other stanzas, making only bits and pieces of them
discernable.
