Outside the Graveyard~
A windworn arch rises to the west of you, marking the entrance to the
graveyard that the dead of Trellor call their home. It is said they are not the
only ones that call it their home. But in this calm silence you do not feel
daunted. Here, outside the graveyard, the birds still sing.

The Stone Arch~
A magnificent, though cracked, stone arch rises over the graveyard entrance.
It is almost completely enshrined in deep green ivy, and rumoured to keep
the spirits of the dead among the tombs.

The Mausoleum~
You pass into a room perpetually illuminated by torchlight which
carries an aura and vague odor of death. This is where the prominent
dead of the city of Trellor are lain in coffins entombed forever
within ancient stone walls.

The Stairwell in the Mausoleum~
Climbing the Mausoleum stairwell, you can hear with distinct pleasure
alluring songs of the minions of the wind goddess playing the silver
chimes from the garden above you. The only other exit is down, into
the main room of the Dead.

The Wind Chime Garden~
 You step out into the beautiful garden of the wind chimes, which is said to be
built by the wind goddess in a moment of frivolity. The winds from all over the
land seem to congregate here to play like living beings, and make music from
the precious hanging chimes of pure shimmering silver. You are too enthralled
by their sirenous songs to leave by any means other than magic.

The Base of a Windworn Oak~
A particularly large, wind-scarred black oak stands before you, eons old
and gnarled of limb and trunk. The knobs in the side make it easy climbing,
but there is something ominous about the tree that would cause the wise
to hesitate. You notice the trunk of the oak has been carved with some
tiny writing.

Climbing the Windworn Oak~
As you ascend the black, weathered trunk of the oak, the winds rise eerily
as if by some strange magic, blowing your hair and the leaves of the tree.
There is definitely a strange, protected aura about this place.

The Nest of the Guardians~
It seems you have climbed too far up a tree sacred to a goddess. In the
darkness luminous with magic, two pairs of dark round eyes are carried
swiftly towards you on deathly silent wings.

It apeears to be more of a patch of land, set aside to bury the poor who
can't afford to get their own tombstone and grave.  It almost feels like
the spirits of those who were buried here are watching all of your moves.

The Necromancers' Sanctum Mortis~
   This is the Sanctum Mortis of the Sorcerers of Undeath. Rancid fumes
fill the air from unholy incenses, obscuring drawn and carved sigils and
circles of power on the floor, ceiling and walls. Strange decanters of
unhealthy-looking stuff and scrolls of all sorts cover the work tables and
shelves. Along the east wall is a rack of hundreds of small, glowing blue
bottles. Tiny, agonized apparitional faces peer at you you through the
crystal walls of those bottles, lips moving silently. They seem to be
asking -- pleading for your help to free them. Do you dare?

looking at you, pleading for you to help them escape and be free.
