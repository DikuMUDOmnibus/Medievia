Floating in Mid Air~
Looking up and down you can see nothing but empty sky, occupied only by white
wisps of clouds. Far out of your reach, perhaps several miles away, you can
see darker storm clouds, and an occasional flash of lightning. The breeze
picks up and blows through your hair, creating a brief panic as you feel
a falling sensation. One glace over at the black tiled path snaps you back
to reality. This is where the Plane of Air meets our world, if it were not
for the magical protection of this castle, you would float off into the vast
nothingness.

An Indoor Forest~
You are on a narrow worn down dirt path through the forest. Small trees of
all kinds surround you and a few larger old trees sit farther back off the
path. The terrain is slightly hilly with various sized rocks jutting up
from the ground, one even has a vibrant purple flower growing from a small
pocket of dirt in its side. A few of the rocks are worn smooth and low to the
ground, providing a comfortable place to sit.

You are on an expanse of a sparkling blue lake. The water is calm for

past you, breaking up and dissipating in the distance. Waterfalls pour

suddenly as they began. Small whirlpools twist and move about sporadically
before closing up and leaving no trace. A tall, gray stone wall blocks your

Greetings Adventurers!
Welcome to the Forbidden Forest! We are very happy to see your faces
in this corner of the world.  The zone is suitable for levels 1-20, with
secrets and details lurking behind every rock and tree.  Look out for the
locals, who are friendly (hopefully) and desire to invite you to dinner.
This area will be under changes and revisions, so expect the unexpected.

Knee-Deep in Lake~
The cold water caresses your body, making you grit your teeth. Your brain
tells you to return to the shore by going east, but you sense something
of importance ahead. The lake gets deeper to the west.  A strange, yellow
mass of some rubbery material is at your feet, submerged in the shallow waters
of the lake.

Your extremities begin to feel numb as the cold water surrounds your body.

small whirlpool can be seen northward. The lake depth decreases to the

on the surface of the water.

these grugach elves.  If not for the fact that you might damage them in the
process of transportation, you would certainly reclaim them for the entire
kingdom of Medevia.

This is opposed to the more common human tradition of might making right.
Grugach elven culture has similarities, but many differences to that of
humans.

She Who Is Not to Be Named.  This portrait is starkly gothic and brutal

This tapestry is long and winding, having 3 distinct segments.  They all
portray long, drawn out battles and sieges between the two races of elf,
dark and grugach.  The Drow are portrayed with strange, fearsome cowls and
dangerous masks; the Grugach are no less fearsome, although they are bathed
in light.  Under each of the seperate battle sequences is a list of names in
(what was it called again? Sperethiel?) the Elven tongue.  You could stand

To Silthas Venomblade, Master of the Underdark,
We know that your city lies under the earth, and that you have raided our
beloved forests and glades time and time over again this epoch.  However, we
shall certainly retaliate with overwhelming force and destroy you and
your heathenous, vile spider priest cohorts.  Lolth herself shall shudder and
mourn over the loss of so many of her worthless followers.  Goodness and
beauty MUST prevail over your debaucherous sacrifices and evil, and we SHALL
succeed.  However, if you submit to our judgement and return to the fold, we
shall be able to avert this strategy. So if you have ANY concern for your
subjects, no matter how base they be, I tell you... heed my words.
