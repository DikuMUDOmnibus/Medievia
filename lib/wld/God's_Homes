whose floor is made from teak and mahogany engraved with the symbolic future
of medievia. A serpentine barre weaves its way across an ornate mirror
taken from a byzantine emperor's bedroom by Vryce as a present for her.
A glow from the center of the earth provides warmth and light for this
breathtaking place for rebecca to dance in private, or for the other gods!

A lonely cabin on a windswept mountainside~
You've come here to be alone. There's not another human within a hundred
miles, yet you're still not remote enough to soothe the aching in your
soul. Your only neighbors are a raucous family of swallowtails that swoop
and chitter in the tree outside your window. You feel more kinship however,
with the lone eagle you spot soaring over the peak across the valley. Barely
more than a speck on the horizon, he soars above the jagged rocks on a cushion
of air.  After contemplating this a while, you feel better and stretch out
in front of the fireplace on the bearskin rug to play with the puppy.

Cavern behind the falls~
You are awstruck by the natural beauty of the cavern.  To the west is a
large opening where the waterfall rushes past in a wall of fury.  The light
making its way through the falling water casts rays of light onto the
smooth irregular walls, creating a magical light versus shadow effect.
The cavern must be truly ancient, its walls have been worn smooth by time
and there are some stalactites and stalagmites of odd shapes and colors
here and there.  A simple table and chair has been designed here from
finely crafted walnut and bearskin.  Some books Vryce has been reading lay
on the table with bookmarks marking his place.  One of the stalagmites has
been cut flat on its top, on it is a simple camping stove with some
hot choclate kept warm.

You stand besides the rushing water of the falls.  The roar of the falls
is like a constant thunder, mist fills the air, giving it a natural
sweet taste.  There are some finely crafted steps carved out of the
cliff face leading to the lagoon 70 feet below.  To the east is a large
opening in the cliff behind the falls.  From here you can see the valley
below, it is quite a sight, you stop a moment and watch the water crash
into the lagoon below, quickly focusing your attention back to the
slippery stone steps.

Along the clifface~
You carefully negotiate the narrow steps carved into the cliff, the
wonderful sights of the adjacent mountain and the valley below tempt you
with sights right out of a postcard.  Some flowering bushes have been
re-planted along the edge of the steps recently by Vryce.

Western lookout~
 This is the highest lookout point on the western side of the mountain. Vryce
comes here in the mornings to watch the sun rise in the west. As the new sun
heats the cool damp air, it creates thermals that are ideal for the raptors
passing by the mountain range. There is a new telescope set into the railing
and a board Vryce uses to count the passing raptors. You can see a pair of
hawks below, circling as they wait for their next meal to show itself. A lone
eagle soars high above, lazily turning from side to side as it waits for a
strong thermal capable of lifting it above and over the mountain.

Slippery steps~
As you follow the steps, you wonder just how safe you are, a mis-step
away from thousands of tons of pure crushing power.  You bravely peer down
into the chaos below and hope that the sights are worth this.

Slippery steps~
You slowly follow the steps, keeping your balance by leaning against the
cliff face.  The mist is very heavy here and clings to everything in reach.
The roar of the falls is deafening, the cliff seems to vibrate from the
sheer power of this natural wonder.

that leads you along your way.  The Roar of the falls crashing into the
lagoon somewhere close by rips through you making your teeth chatter.

A Raging Waterfall~
You have reached the northernmost point of the river Carthein, unless you can
fly, there isn't much you can do, since a great waterfall looms before you, if
you were to travel north any further, you would not be able to see for the
mist, and would probably be pulled under by the great force of the falls.

On the mantle are some of his wildlife pictures.  A comfy looking
fairly large bed takes up most of the room, scattered on its headpiece are
some books Vryce has been reading.  There is some fishing gear in one corner
of the room.  Vryce's camera and gear sits on a chest at the foot of the bed.
The bed is has some overstuffed pillows and a large flannel blanket that
looks as if Vryce just through it on, not really making the bed.

By the steps(next to the falls)~
You stand near the edge of the lake, the falls are Crushing down into the
lake 20 feet away, creating a fine mist.  The whole area is alive with
rainbow effects from the mist and the swirling air currents created by
the massive water fall so close.  The ground at your feet trembles with
the rythem of the impact as the water pounds into the lake.  The lake
is postcard perfect, surrounded by woods on all sides and exiting in
a swift river system to the south.

into it to the east and the towering mountains surrounding it, you feel
an overpowering sensation of awe at the proportions and overall beauty of
this area.  Its almost as if ... a god has touched the area recently.

At the edge of the lake~
You walk up to the crystal clear lake and stand in awe at the mountain
on the other side.  It stands in front of the lake like a tall guardian,
watching over all of medievia.  Crashing into the lake is a huge
waterfall which starts at the top of the mountain, gaining
speed and power on its long journey in free fall, ending in an awe
inspiring Thunder as it impacts the stillness of the lake.
This is where all of medievia's water systems start, from somewhere
up there.       You look up. Scary.

The loft~
The room smells of jasmine and maplewood. There is a queensize brass
bed against the far wall. It has two ruffled fluffy pillows on it.
One has the embroidered name of Benji, the other Megan. A large
comforter is stretched across the bed. The ruffles of the pillows
match the curtains on the shutter doors and the ruffles around the
bed.  There is a large mirrored dresser on the far side of the room
and a large heart-shaped picture frame sitting on it.  The fella
in the picture is the apple of her eye.  You would have to read her
diary to know his name though.  To each side of her mirror are shelves
of dolls.  The sweet floral smell that fills the room probably comes
from the vases of freshly cut flowers that sit on her dresser
and on her night stand.

You have just entered puppy heaven.  There are puppy toys from

of the room with Benji's favorite shoe on it.  The walls are lined with
stuffed animals. Unlike most puppies, Benji would never chew up a
stuffed animal, he loves them dearly.  Cuddling up with that 3ft.
bear in the corner is the only way Benji knows how to take a nap.  That
bear was a gift from Megan on his 5th month birthday.

inlayed design of the terrace itself resembles two doves in flight.
You can see forever looking over the terrace rails to the mountain and
stream below.  This is one of Megan's favorite spots to sit and dream,
and watch the stars dance in the skies at night.

The Kitchen~
A cute lil kitchen over looking the mountain. The baywindow
opens to the fresh breeze rushing with the stream besides the cottage.
In front of the window is a breakfast table with two chairs. Fresh
flowers are in the center. The china cabnit beside the side door
has the china set that was given to Megan' mother on her wedding
day. The china is Lunichia and the crystal is the best that can be found.
Everything matches in color and design. The walls are the same
country blue of the pillows on the breakfast chairs. Pots and pans
hang from a half circle brass shelf above the stove. You feel in
this kitchen many good meals are cooked and eaten.

The Garden~
The garden lines the path to the stream. The stream is almost a
crystal clear soft blue. In the stream are beautifully pollished
rocks from all the years it has rushed over them. The garden
is full of minature roses and flowers of all sorts. Megan mostly
planted flowers of different shades of red since Megan is partial
to red, but all colors are represented by one flower or another.
Fushia carnations and lily clusters bring out the gardens bouquet of
color. Off on the green grass over the white painted bridge that
crosses the stream is a swing. This is a beautiful place to sit and
watch the bird stop at the daisy bird wash or watch the stars at night.
The clearing right beside it is perfect for picnics.

A Small White Bridge~
You are on a small white bridge that crosses over a beautiful
softly flowing stream that lines a garden full of flowers.
Looking down over the edge you can see many multi colored fish
swimming beneath your feet.  With the garden on one side and a nice
picnic clearing on the other, it is hard to decide which way
to go.

Picnic Clearing.~
In the big oak tree to the right is a big white swing. Many
wonderful days and nights were spent swinging in this swing.
To the left is a clearing that is cluttered only with the occasional
dandelion. Shaded by the largest tree on the mountain, this
spot is like Megan' own little peace of heaven.
Megan' red and white checkered blanket is still spread out from her
last picnic. Maybe you want to stretch out and enjoy this
peaceful time.

After examining the Super Nintendo under an electron microscope for a billion
hours, Vryce has concluded that the damn thing is the lightest shade of purple
he has ever seen. Anyway, if you've never seen a Super Nintendo, go out, pick
up a catalog, and look at one. You think I'm going to describe it for you? Get

Vryce's Dining Room Area~
This is Vryce's dining room, despite it's name, there's no dining done in this
room. It's more an extension of the Living room. There's a large fifty five
gallon aquarium here, a very huge wood and plexiglass cage on the west wall,
and a china closet on the north wall. A window overlooks the street outside
next to the aquarium. You see Vryce's Camera equipment everywhere.
Items you can look at: Aquarium, Cage, Window

cage~
This cage is made of white pine, with a huge window on the front, a miniature
environment for Vryce's pet snake Princess, a red-tailed boa constrictor, who
lies here in the cage, in a mock-up of a tunnel, which has an area into which
you can look to see the snake lying in there, doing snake-like things. The
cage was custom built by Vryce and even has a running water fall!

~
E
stove~
This is another big white box, you put food in or on it to make it hot.
~
E
sink~
This is a thing that produces water, magically I assume. It has a big basin,
which can be filled with water to wash dishes in.
~
E
counter~
This is a flat surface area, upon which things can be put. (Amazing wonders of
the 20th century abound eh?)
~
E
cage~
I KNEW you'd wonder about this...
This is a parrot cage, upon the parrot cage sits Merlin... An African Gray
Parrot. I wouldn't get too close as he's not friendly to strangers. He's gray,
as his name suggests, with a red tail. Normally he'd be talking up a storm.
Maybe you make him nervous?
~
E
cabinets~
These are things with doors on them, into which Vryce and (who-knows) put
objects, like, boxes of food, and dishes, and so forth. (Boy I bet you're glad

Vryce's Back Yard~
This is Vryce's back yard, contrary to what you might expect, there isn't much
"yard" to speak of. There's a small alley along side of the house, with a
fence to one side. And behind the house is an area about 4 yards by 6 yards in
size. There's a nice gas grill here, that's about it.
You notice anytime you look to the west, your mind gets disoriented and
what you see as a fuzzy quality.
Items you can look at: Grill.

Vryce's office, the bathroom, and through to Vryce's bedroom. But I'd knock
first if I were you... Vryce can be doing strange things in there!
You see a NEWLY made locker set into the wall..
You can smell the new cedar coming from the new walk in closet to the North.

E
computer~
This is Vryce's computer. Here's the technical specifications as far as you
can tell. It's a 486/50 EISA Local Bus machine, with a NEC MultiSync 3d
monitor, a Logitec mouse, SVGA Graphics, lots of hard drive space, and
displayed prominently on the screen is a picture of one of hundreds of nude
women Vryce seems to like to collect pictures of. He has Windows 3.1 loaded
up, and at any given time, you're likely to see a screen full of C code so
complicated you might wonder if ANYONE could understand it.
~
E
drums~
Vryce's drums are electronic, (what's electronic mean? I have no idea).
Obviously they work on some kind of magic, since they're simply pads with no
wood or skins. Surrounding the drums there are some pieces of PVC tubing,
which are not easy to describe but trust me when I say they're the cymbals.
Hanging from the ceiling on a retractable cord is a towel, and a big amplifier
sits behind the drums. (Once again, what's an amplifier? I have no idea). More
magic I guess.
~
E
fish~
A lonely little goldfish swims in a plastic aquarium here.
~
E
camping~
Various pieces of camping equipment rest here, or are hung on hangers and
hooks on the wall. Some stuff is shoved up on a shelf here. Vryce is obviously
the epitomy of an outdoorsman, never leaving home without a portable computer,
video game, and several other electronic gadgets and 21st century style
camping paraphanalia. You wonder how he'd do it if he had to really live off
the land.
~
E
books~
A large collection of books by various authors line the walls, and lay about
the room.
~
E
puppets~
A puppet that looks remarkably like the Medievia Mascot "Scruff" sits here
next to the desk, along with a Raccoon puppet with a charming personality, who
Vryce claims helps him to program. Scruff has his doubts, and tells you that
Podo couldn't program his way out of a paper bag without his help.

You stand in a large, but rather modest rustic home built into a Vale Tree.
You see a large Raptor stand for Darkwind's BondBird Vree built into the wall
by a window. The lighting is warm and against the inner wall lies a bed
made of dozens of simple soft pillows. Besides a small table by the bed
and a privacy screen on the north wall, the room is open and empty.

Natural hot spring, under Darkwind's Ekel~
You are under Darkwinds private Ekel. Darkwind, as Starblade's son and chief
scout has the best tree in the Vale, complete with a natural Hot Spring in
front of you. You are overcome by the pleasant smells of the scented and
oiled spring, which seems to call to you with a magic of its own. You've never
felt so secure as you are with Darkwind in his Legendary Vale, who's
magic has held strong through centuries of war and chaos. You feel a sense of
belonging here, being taken in as wingsib, with these proud couragious people
whom have fought evil since before the Great Wars.  To think, just a month ago
you were Elsepeh, heir to the throne of Valdenor, being forced into a political
marriage.  Now you find out you have enormous Mage Talents, you can
mindspeech with BondBirds, and something else you never thought would happen
again, you've found True Love. Here you are not royalty, here you belong,
surrounded by your wingsibs, the only outsider to be taken in and given a
home in the Vale.

The Vale of Starblade~
You stand and marvel at the beauty of the Vale. The trees, so tall they
reach some lower clouds and wider than some homes in your kingdom of Valdenor.
The entire Vale is kept up by the magic of the Darkstone, which you
thought was just legend. You see Darkwinds Ekel on a tree to the North,
100 spans up, it is a magnificent structure partially built, partially part
of a wonderful tree. All around you see Darkwind's wingsibs homes and
large intelligent birds, called Bondbirds. You feel like part of a fairy
tail as you remember the legendary stories told to you as a sibling about
these wonderful people, the Vale and bondbirds.

an adventure.  A large fireplace heats the room, and there is a large mirror on

A bedroom~
A large, richly furnished bedroom.  Against the north wall is a king sized
waterbed, covered by black satin sheets with many flannel blankets thrown
on top.  Next to the bed, on either side, is a small night table, made of
sweet smelling pine.  The east wall of this room does not exist, instead,
there is a railing over which you can look down into the living room.  The
vaulted ceiling of the room below continues over to this room and the south
wall is almost entirely made up of windows, providing a magnificent view
of the ocean and sunrise.  Your feet are comforted by a thick, soft rug,
covering the whole floor.  A doorway to the west leads to a walk in closet
and the spiral staircase leading down to the living room is in the north
east corner.  A large circular sky light is built in the center of the
ceiling to let in the late day sun as well as the moonlight.

Secret tunnel~
The tunnel glows with a bright penetrating red light.  You have to
squint to keep your eyes open as the light is so harsh.  The wall has a
image engraved into it.  The whole thing takes place at some large castle,
it depicts a man and a woman fighting an army of monsters.
To the side is another woman joining the fight.  The detail of the thing is
like magic.  The closer you get the more you can see.  If you peer into
the window by the east side you see a bedroom with the door bashed in and
undead skeletons lying about in broken heaps.  Perhaps this is where the
battle started.

The walls here have an unnatural glow, filling the area with a dream like

dancing in a forest, with a man watching her, sitting
by a tree.  Gathered all around are animals, all watching this strange
woman dance.

You have entered into a warm and cozy mountain cottage.  You feel
warmth from both the fireplace in front of you and the love
radiating from the cottage itself.  There is a plush fur rug thrown
in front of the fireplace.  The rug is surely imatation since Megan
would never hurt an animal.  There are various pictures of Megan and her
puppy she named Benji.  On either side of the pictures are coal oil lamps.
The furniture is made of hard maple wood and the floor of laced pine.
There are beautiful plants and trees all about the room.  You
sense you are very welcome here.
Mister, her blue billed parrot is on his little stand.  He loves to pirch
there and have Megan read books to him and Benji by the light of the fire.

thought of annoying him.  You wonder how Vryce lives here, so high up,
so close to the presense of god...you wonder if God and Vryce are friends..
Shiver..you wake from your thoughts to notice a button that you swear was
not part of the cliff face a moment ago.  Perhaps you should push it?

-= Ak and Sulty's Boxing Ring =-~
As you enter here the first thing you notice is the view. Mountains
stretch in every direction and the sky is like an overturned brilliant blue
bowl above you.
    The second thing you notice is that you are not standing on anything
visible! It is as if you are floating in midair, but there is something of
substance beneath you. You can see a river meandering between the mountains far
below and you can make out clusters of buildings that must be cities or
villages. The ocean shimmers in the distance to the west. Looking down you
get the distinct impression you may start falling at any second...
Look at the RING to see where the actual bouts are held.

The menu sucks, looks like every other stupid mud in the world.
WHAT ELSE can it do?  Show who is online, give MUDINFO command.. show

can it do?  Feel free to edit this as you think of things, dont forget
