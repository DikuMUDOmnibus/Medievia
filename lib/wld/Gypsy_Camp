The Edge of the Slope~
You stand atop a steep rocky slope, giving you a view of a small dense forest
lining the hill's sunken interior like a woven rug of deep emerald. The cries
of birds from below are easily carried to your ears, and also, you think, an
odd lilting harmonious sound, as that of strange music.

Everywhere you look innocent-looking creatures move about through the brush,

A Dark Forest Path~
The last of the light falling from the sky is blotted out by the density
of the leafy canopy above you, but something other than that must be
creating the sense of gloom you feel stepping onto this dark path.
All around you seems quiet...too quiet, perhaps, for an average forest.

For the touch of a second distant music, alluring and highly exotic, reaches

wander this forlorn path. Then your attention is drawn to the sight of several
colorfully-clad strangers with menacing faces lingering to the west of you,
and you feel oddly very far from the safety of your home.

Several lamps strung on ropes nailed to posts cast a lurid glow over the
camp's entrance. There is an aura of craftiness that pervades the place,
and you are reminded by the inquisitive stares of the wary residents
at your belongings that this band does not make its living by honesty
and fair-dealing.  You wounder if it isn't more prudent to return to the
safe walls of the city while your legs are still intact.

weaponry of a gypsy is always ready in hand, rather than displayed idly
where it could disappear mysteriously. A single globe of dim light hangs
suspended by a chain from the ceiling, and by its cast the guards find
plenty to do to entertain themselves.  This they do mostly by way of high
stake dice games and sparring matches in which the concept of 'rules'
is quite foreign.

You pass under many giant oaks hung with lamps on every limb, their silver
glinting brightly with the many colors of rose, green, amber and blue that
they have been illuminated with. The eerie, lively music of the gypsy
minstrels rings out from the players at the edges of the ring, tempting
you to join in wild dance with the colorfully clad members of the infamous
band who whirl about in disarray, seeming not to notice you.
To the south and east lie tents of suppliers to the troup, and the path
through the camp continues west.

day and night, sending the cold pricks of a shiver down your spine.

The walls of the tent are bare, but an iron vault can be opened at any time
for the perusal of the sturdy and often grossly ornamented armor of the
armourer's private collection. Although he seldom makes a sale, by our
understanding of the term, he greatly enjoys an opportunity to boast his
wares.

The smells of the hot spices, customary to gypsies, stings your nose and
causes the blood to rush to your face just stepping into this narrow place.
Dingy pans hang unwashed on every wall of the tent, and the earth below
your feet seems slippery from countless drunken spills of oily food.
You do not need a town doctor to warn you that anything made here would
eat a hole in your stomach.

You step into a warm, spacious tent, its walls hung with braided cords
of black and dark red for meager decoration. The breeze that flows in
from the entrance to the south is not enough to air out the stench of
ale, perfumed oils and sweat that hangs about the whole tent. Seasoned
gamblers eye you and make amiable smiles that contradict the hungry
gleams in their eyes. They obviously take all townsfolk for foolish
novices, and look forward to a profit.

Old vaults of an unknown metal, patched with rust, line the walls of
the treasury of the funds of the gypsy people. Through briberies which
you dare not question, they have gained some limited access to the town
treasuries, so that citizens visiting can withdraw before they are slain
by gypsy steel. Perhaps you should be careful.

table, old and cracked from the banging fists of rowdy gypsies. No
one but you seems to notice the few corpses that lie quietly piled in
a corner. The room is lit by dim, dull crimson and white glows from
two lamps, and you find this light so conducive to trying your own
luck that you, too, soon forget.

his gruesome array of goods under his watchful eye. The question only
remains where you would be shown them, and he is known to prefer the
throat.

dim light they cast to illuminate different sides of the small shrubs and
forest herbs of the place. Everywhere you go through this residential area
the lurid eyes of gypsies are on you, and you wonder if they will wait for
an excuse to show their fighting prowess. Is it that they do not appreciate
a stranger so close to their homes?

that some kind of raid is being planned that you were not meant to
overhear. Several high-ranking gypsies are seated and standing around
a large oak table in heated discussion, amidst half-drained silver
goblets and scattered maps. They cannot let you return where you came
from with such information, now, could they?

Smells so richly exotic as to be tawdry drift thickly out of the lit
interior of the cave, and you can catch glimpses of expensive rugs,
golden candlesticks, and other fineries inside. Such wealth can only
belong to the chief of this troup.

of shining weaponry and armor inside crystal glass cabinets. In contrast to the
homes of others of this band, the place is fastidiously clean: a squarely
arranged black rug, polished oak table, two silver goblets set in symmetry with
two candlesticks of the same precious metal. The Master must be terribly
confident in his abilities to allow such a conspicuous display of wealth.
Luckily for you, he is not in at the moment.

to cover the natural dank smells of the cave. Thick foreign rugs
comfort your feet, crimson candles flicker from their ornate
holders and downy black sofas adorn the place. What takes first
priority in your awareness, however, is the rage of the Chief
that you have so carelessly invaded his sanctuary.

gypsy could have told you the Chief's cook has a strange sense of humor.

adorned with dark green candles in golden holders. You can still smell
what was eaten here at the last meal of the Chief...and though it is
doubtless delicious to them, you know it would take quite some inducement
for you to dine on what must be heavily spiced refuse.

A Muddy Pool~
You wade into the muddy, shallow waters that is the water supply of the
dingy camp. There is a raised slab of mud in the center, just wide enough
to sleep on, and a few scattered water lilies manage to brighten an other-
wise dreary place.

A Path Through the Gypsy Camp~
You pass into a residential area of the camp, as you can tell by the
scattered hastily-constructed shanties, as well as the more defensive
than amused glares of the gypsies who call this their home. Their
obvious hostility is more than alarming, considering their numbers.

A Path Through the Gypsy Camp~
 The limbs of the giant oaks surrounding you bend low and rise again over the
path like the graceful swoop of a bird. You have to duck to go under them, the
leaves brushing your face. Wild herbs grow everywhere just off the paths,
sending their mild scents up into the air.

A Gypsy Shanty~
You step into a small shanty, built of canvas, tarps, and posts and
furnished with layers of shaggy rugs that provide the perfect home to
a number of insects. The barefoot residents do not notice this however,
in fact at the moment they seem quite too preoccupied with your uninvited
presence to notice much of anything else. They do not seem inclined to
hospitality, perhaps it would be better not to stay?

A Path Through the Gypsy Camp~
The sounds of the wild music have receded to the distant part of the camp,
and the birds and other wildlife seem mysteriously hushed along this path.
Thick exotic scents waft in from the covered wagon to the west, and a strange
glowing aura exudes from that place that fills you with a sense of mystery.
The path returns through the camp to the east.

The Fortune Teller's Wagon~
Three dozen strange baubles dangle tantalizingly from the ceiling of this
wagon covered with several layers of thick black canvas. Fur-lined pillows
lie in massive piles, the rich scents of fine amber and frankincense dull
your senses, and a voluptuous woman is seductively draped over a low couch
of burgundy. On a small table rests a large rose-colored crystal ball,
and upon one wall hang seedy portraits of the brothers of the fortune teller:
all twenty-eight of them, armed and ready to defend this 'helpless' woman
should she give one cry for help.

The Gypsy Jug~
Even the gypsies, with their fame in legends for alcohol consumption
such as puts the greatest warriors to shame, have their limits, as
you can see by the many slumbering bodies that litter this tavern,
stinking of ale. So this is where your stolen pocket money goes.

The Gambling Tent~
You follow the dark rug through the tent, feeling the inquisitive eyes of
gypsies on your back. The odors of tobacco smoke and wine come thick
from the north and south, where card tables and players await your
feeble attempts at luck.

The Chief's Card Table~
Fine cabinets of old mahogany, locked and guarded, hold the Gypsy Chief's
private stash of liquors and gold. Soft, worn velvet of ebony and dark red
is draped in dipping arcs across all the walls--this place alone smells
of sweet amber from far away, and rich, well-grown tobacco. The round
table is of the same old precious mahogany, and is carefully watched by
guards for signs of cheaters. The Chief himself, of course, may cheat all
he likes.
