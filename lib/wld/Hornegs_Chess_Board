A white square~
You in a small section of a large table that you seemingly jumped onto.  The
floor here is painted white and outlined in gold to separate it from the
surrounding squares.  Looking up, you can see the room where you were before
entering the chess board, now it's upside down and you're right side up.

A black square~
You in a small section of a large table that you seemingly jumped onto.  The
floor here is painted black and outlined in gold to separate it from the
surrounding squares.  Looking up, you can see the room where you were before
entering the chess board, now it's upside down and you're right side up.
