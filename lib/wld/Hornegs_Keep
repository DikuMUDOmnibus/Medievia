A stone path~
You travel upon a stone trail.  It looks as though it was just laid out, but
never walked upon.  A few small plants struggle to survive, growing out of
the dirt-filled cracks between the stone.  To the south, a large stone building
rises from a heavy cloud which seems to be suffocating everything about it.

You travel upon a stone trail.  It looks as though it was just laid out, but
never walked upon.  A few small plants struggle to survive, growing out of
the dirt-filled cracks between the stone.  To the south, a large stone building
rises from a heavy cloud which seems to be suffocating everything about it.
The bluff drops sharply directly to your north.  Looking over the cliff, you can
see a small trail winding its way up the mountain.

 You have reached the end of the passageway, and the walls shed very little

As you enter this dark, musty room, you choke on the dust and stench of decay

On a misty path~
The world seems to be spinning benieth your feet.  You keep your eyes closed
tightly and crouch low to the ground, clutching at it in an attempt to
steady yourself.  Slowly, you begin to regain your sense of direction and
equilibrium and cautiously open your eyes.  The first thing you notice is
a stoney, gray path beneith you, wide enough to fit three humans abreast.
You glance around, starting at the empty void which lies on either side of
the stone path.  A few feet into the blackness, a strange crimson and grey
mist swirls, obscuring your vision.  Even though there are no visible
light sources, the path is well lit... You have entered the Demi-Plane of
Magic.

You look out the hole and see the inky blackness that is the night.
The darkness seems to move of its on accord. You feel it move in on you
but you turn your head just in time. You shiver to think what would
have happened if you looked much longer.

You have stumbled upon Horneg's laboratory sleeping area.  A small cot with a

to life.

Along the northern drop~
You travel upon a stone trail.  It looks as though it was just laid out, but
never walked upon.  A few small plants struggle to survive, growing out of
the dirt-filled cracks between the stone.  To the south, a large stone building
rises from a heavy cloud which seems to be suffocating everything about it.
The bluff drops sharply directly to your north.  Looking over the cliff, you can
see a small trail winding its way up the mountain.

to the north.  A land which until recently no one had ventured to guess what
lay that far north.  The site for this painting is a large open valley, teeming
with vegetation, but yet covered in a frost unlike any seen in the local area.
An old plateau lies to the right of this valley upon which, you, very clearly,
make out the figure of an old man with hair and beard as colorless as the frost
itself and long as a day standing, waving a knurled staff frantically is if
evoking a cantation, the likes of which long forgotten.

The large stone pedestal rests about five and a half feet above the ground.  It
appears that this was used to address anyone fortunate enough to be guests in
this dining hall, for all its splendor.

Southern corner~
You are in the southern corner of the large dining hall.  It is fairly dark

against the eastern wall, calls for your attention.

Secret alcove~
You have found a room that many have used to hide from Horneg and
his minions. Many died here trying to recover from their many
wounds. The pain, anguish and sorrow they felt permeates the small
alcove. You feel saddened at their plight, yet glad you are not
experiencing it yourself.... as of yet.

You have entered what you would consider a high-powered mages laboratory.
There are shelves with books surrounding the entire room, a large table with
beakers that boil and bubble over with liquids of various colors.  A floating
orb in the center of the room reveals it in a blue haze, but definately a nice
change from the rest of the keep.  A large painting of a beautiful woman about
in her late twenties is hung gloriously on the southern wall of the room.  A
smaller table in the corner of the room has many squares of alternating white
and black, and some pieces that look to be carved from the finest marble are
set upon it.
Hovering in the center of the north wall is a swirling portal of silver mist.

This hall is very poorly lit, even with a light source.  It seems as if the
walls are absorbing the light.  The hall continues on to the north and south.

You can sense a branch here to the east, but with the darkness, you cannot
tell what awaits you around the corner.
