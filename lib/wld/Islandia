You stand in a large pit dug miles deep into the ground. You are standing
on a circular piece of rock and are surrorounded by a lake of boiling blood.
The bones and corpses of the fools who challanged the inhabitents of
this mighty stronghold are scattered on the ground and some heads have
been nailed into the rock.  This cavern is very deep into the ground and
the only light source is the dark glow emitted from the lake.

The Castle Loft~
As you enter Rasters Sky Loft, You are amazed at how high up you are. You
look
out the HUGE window which covers the entire east wall of the room, you see
the entire land of Medievia beneath you. In the distance you can see the
peak of Mt Vryce where poor souls go to ask pity from gods. This is truely
a special place.  As you look around the huge room, you see the ceiling
strenches very high and the top is very blurry as if the room extended
into the heavens. On one side of the room is a very expensive Persian
carpet with a Oak desk. As you peer at the desk you gasp at the sight of
the Compact version of the Connection Machine V.  On the other side of the
room is a MEGA blasting stereo and CD player, next to the stereo is a HUGE
100 inch TV and a very confortable leather couch where Raster relaxs from
the constant stress of an adventurers life.

The Outer Plane of Elysium~
You stand on the twelth out plane of Elysium. The winds of neutrality
and good flow strong here. A slow moving blue river flows here in
space, it's banks are invisible and there seems to be nothing
through which the river is flowing. In the center there is a massive
clear onyx chamber. The chamber seems to float on thin air and within the
chamber is very different from the outside.
The contexts of the chamber seem to be inside the prime material plane
while everything else outside of it is sitting within the plane of
Elysium. There seems to be some type of magic portal that created this
pocket of space, within the box there is a soft sofa and a fire place. A
small cat wanders about within the box.

A small open air courtyard~
You stand in a small courtyard in the castle. This room seems to be
a entranceway to the private homes built in this castle. There is a small
pond with small multicolored fish swimming through it and beautifal
flowers built in each side of the pebble pathway leading leading to
each of the individual homes. In the center of the fountain there is
a statue of a great mage named Hai, the sun reflects on the adamantite
statue in such a special way giving it a uncanny brilliance that would
put anyone into a trance. You also notice a small grey kitten playing
near the flowers.

sign~
The sign reads:
The ROOM to the east is a *PRIVATE* conference room. That means if I
am in there and you walk in.. Your dead. If I am at home and the door is
unlocked.. That does NOT mean you can walk in... If you walk in uninvited,
am in there and you walk in.. Your dead. If I am at home and the door is
unlocked.. That does NOT mean you can walk in... If you walk in uninvited,
your dead also.. If you want to hold meeting etc in the conference room
that is fine just as long as I am not online. If I am online, ask me first.
I added my office to the house so people could come and talk to me easier.

The Cottage by the Ocean~
You stand in a small secluded cottage by the ocean. You can hear the waves
from the Ocean rolling in on to the beach and the seagulls roaming the
sky. This small cottage seems to be a very humble place. There is a
hammock in the corner attached to the bamboo and straw walls of this
little house.  There is a small table with a book resting on it and a fire
stove in the corner. You feel a sense of peace here.
