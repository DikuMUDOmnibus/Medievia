On the banks of Lake Contnea ~
You stand on the south east shore of Lake Contnea. Little patches of green
grass grow amoungst the rock that makes up the shoreline. The lake looks so
beautiful from here, it almost seems as if it is calling you to it. You
stumble as you loose your balance from an unstable rock.

On the banks of Lake Contnea ~
You stand on the south east shore of lake Contnea. Little patches of green
grass grow amongst the rock. A crude fence of animal bones and sticks is to
the north. Beyond the fence the ground is lifeless. Dead trees and twigs spot
the land that protrudes out into the lake.

Before a gate ~
A gate of simple proportions is to the north, leading to the burial grounds
of the village of Contnea. The soil seems to reek of death, dispair and
suffering. This feeling is enhanced by the baren land that lies nortward
contrasted to the grassy path you are on now.

This is the final resting place of The villagers of Lake Contnea. Death came to
them in the package of blood thirsty adventures, a tragic fall, or some other
unfortunate passing. Now their corpses make up a feast for their new neighbor
-- The Conquer worm. Those unfortunate enough to die a violent death
remain here, wandering, seeking the ones who brought death to them. There can
not be eternal rest for them until their torturers are laid to rest.

A sense of near panic overtakes you as you look up to see a huge bolder
just inches above your head. Small schools of fish disperse as they notice
your presence in their hiding place. You can't help but wonder what force,
if any prevents the rock aboce from crushing every bone in your body.

You are just off the western shore of the lake. Mud from the land that has been
washed away with the splashing of the waves on the muddy shore. The broken
stems of plants floating in the water lead you to belive that this is
frequently used means to get to the lake and the island hidden somwhere in

rat that must have come with you on your journey.

To the north are jagged rocks seperating the lake with the island.
Small tracks of sand-colored crabs dot the sand around the rocks, where
they have made their homes. Mabey if you feel in the dirt you could
find one.

sound you thought to be a horn now sounds more like a deep moaning, and
it appears to be comming from a north-easternly direction.  Large rocks
line the cliffside, awaiting someone to impail.

At the mouth of a Small bay~
As you enter this small bay the thick fog suddenly ends. Looking back it
appears that it ends in a perfect wall, as if it were being held back by some
force. The moaning sound continues to get louder as you go further northward
in the bay.

As you stand still you detect an alternating breeze comming from the north

another clifface or some rock for the moaning sound, that continues to gain
volume, is accompanied by a crashing sound.

West of a Cave~
The rock formations here are so wonderfully strange. The breathing like wind
patters appear to come from a complex serise of mini-caves cut into the rock.
To the east appeats to be a larger opening. The bay conti9nues back behind
you.

In a Bank of Fog~
You are engulphed in a bank of fog. The horn is becoming louder as you head
further north. Small fish jump over your feet. One actually jumps up and
bites your toe. It would be rather funny except that it has small, sharp
teeth, which it uses to tear into your flesh.

Before a the "Mouth" of a Cave~
The Stalagtite and Stalagmite formations in the opening of the cave, with the
mini caves that create the wind create the feeling of a face, though not
human there seems to be a greatness and goodness about it. The water crashing
into the rocks is amplified by the acoustics of the cave. The defining
moaning comes from within.

In a bank of fog~
You are engulphed in a bank of fog that seems never to end.  A foul smell
overtakes you. Looking down, you see that you picked up a little fishy.
Eventhough it is dead you throw it back into the water in a act of futility.
Just then a bunch of bubbles and little splashes fill the spot where you
tossed it in. Something tells you this is not an ideal skinnydipping site.

North East of a Bay~
The Cliff Face here has come to a rounded point with jagged rocks making up
alot of the base around the cliff. A small pool is home to a small and
friendly little goldfish. The little goldfish reminds you of your younger
days when you and your comrads would swallow small fish like him whole
between classes and taunting the juvinile members of the other guilds, who,
of course, were far inferior to you.

Delicate and beautiful stalagtites form extravagent patters that form
horrable shadows from the way that your light source hits them, producing
a strange atmosphere for the cave. The "face" of the cliff looks almost
as real inside as it did outside, with the un-nerving exception that you
have been swallowed. A thick slime coats the upwardly sloping floor.

whoever made them was a bit larger than you. A further analysis of the
markings leads you to belive that whoever made this passage was digging
Northward out of what ever is sout of you insted of where you have come
from.

An intersection in the illuminated passageway~
The unnatural passage widens into a more natural surounding. The air is old
and the rock dry. Small veins of some florecent rock bathe the room in a dim
bluse light. Small pieces of the florecent rock lie around the room on the
floor. Small crab like creatures scurry around at your feet.

The passage is gripped in an absloute silence, broken only by the clicking

There is a staircase carved into the rock here. Perfectly made steps spiral
around a central column as they ascend into the total darkness above. As
you look foward to the climb before you, you can't help but to wish you
would have left a few of your extra trinkets behind.

the walls are jagged, yet the florecent parts seem almost smooth, like

They were wrong, and you proved it. It isn't a bottemless pit, you found
the bottem. Too bad you won't live to tell anyone. You lay here slowly the
darkness overtaking you, yet you are aware of sunlight shining down the
shaft and the many wonderful and valueble items left here by other unweary
adventures. You become less aware, a peacefullness over takes you. You
welcome death, the only escape from the horrable pain you feel because you
truely borke every bone in your body.

An empty Throne Dominates this part of the Cavern. On both one side is a
glowing clear orb, the other a glowing black orb. Each orb symbolizing
Good and Evil. The glow of the Black orb seems to be a little more intense,
but now the clear orb seems more intense. A stillness hangs about the room,
and the feeling you are being watched is even greater.

In a field of Golden Grasses ~
Giant stalks of golden grass grow here, hiding all that dwell within it. You
think it is strange how the grass lifts itself back up to its position after
you step off of it, almost as if you were never here. Quickly you turn your
head to try and see what was causing that rustling noise you just heard, but
the grass protects its secrets.

On a narrow strip ~
You stand on a narrow 3 ook wide strip of rock that Protrudes out from the
main island to form a bay to the west. Due to your carelessness you nearly
fall to your instant demise because of a loose rock that you decided to place
your trust in (not to mention all of your body's weight too).

At a rat hole ~
As soon as it sees you coming, a small rat like creature runs into a hold
made by some large boulders that are one atop another. You are shocked by a
loud, almost aggressive clicking sound coming from within the hole, probably
the little bugger trying to frighten you off by clicking its teeth together.
Still you persist by bundling a group of the golden grasses together and
taunting it by shoving the grass into the hole. You get the idea that it
means business from the teeth marks on the remainder of the grass ends.

flowers ~
Delicate red pettals make up the most of the flowers with berries growing at
the base of every plant. Reaching down to pick a small fower for closer
inspection your hands gently brush one of the thorns, tearing your flesh
and allowing small droples stain the dirt. Sensing food the flower plant
breaks the soil as one of its roots absorb the droplets.

a woman pulling a striders blade out of her water container and tossing it back

free wall. Atop the shelf is open a scroll of some sort. The room over all has
a simple feel, simpler than this small village.

The hut of the Royal Chef~
The walls are lined with assorted pots and pans. One spot in piritcular
has the outline of a pan where it protected the crude walls from the smudge
from the fire. Bags of flour and other assorted vegtables lie aginst
the walls and floors. A small cot is made in the corner. Seems the chef
who calls this his kitchen also calls this home.

The Royal Garden ~
The air if filled with the scent of fresh vegetables. Gigantic squash, wild
onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and many other delicious vegetables grow here
all year long. The plants are laid out in a systematic, yet in a pleasing
manner. A fountain feeds a steady stream of water to all the plants while
numerous lady-bugs keep insects away.

On a Pebble Path ~
You stand before the royal Hut. It is unlike any other of the huts, it is
carved out from an extended growh of the huge Thorn bush that grows to the
north. The needle sharp thorns are quite an awesome barrier to protect the
chiefton from any unwelcome visitors.

The Hut of the Royal Guard ~
Hammocks are neatly hung from posts to make bed for the Chiefton's Guard.
Weapons line the walls, ranging from the simple sword to weapons not yet
understood by modern weaponsmiths. You jump as a sleeping guard stirs in
his sleep. Strange you hadn't noticed him until he moved. They are well
trained in many skills you assume from his stealth in such a unprotected
position.

The Royal Hut ~
The inside of the Chiefton's hut is a mixture of nature and royal extravagance.
The thorns on the Thorn bush that make up the entire hut give the room a
natural air. The royal splendor makes it a little awe inspiring. In a Throne
supported by the Thorn vines the chiefton sits controlling the state and his
next menu, while his guard keep watch for any assasians. An exit to the south
leads to the royal garden where the king's meals origanate, and to the east is
a pebble path leading away from the chiefton.

Climbing Up Pure-Marble Stairs ~
You stand on a staircase made of only the finest and purest marble in all the
land. Perfectly equal stairs lead upward to a temple reaching tword the sky.
Carved into the face of each step is the story of the creation of medievia and
especially. The villagers depict themselves as being the chosen people, the
preferred ones of the gods, except the god of evil, horror, and pain.

Inside a Temple ~
You stand beneath a dome of marble, with small veins of colored jewel placed
in it to create beams of colored light. Although the dome is supported by
perfectly white columns it seems to be flying unsupported because of the
blinding light from the outside streaming in. To the north is an alter and to
the east is a staircase leading downward.

At the Altar of the Great One~
Before you is an altar of marble. Behind it is a statue of the god of the
villagers, the only name he has is The Great one. In the arms of the Great
one is a Glowing orb that could symbolize the world he created -- Medievia.
Surrounding him are beings of various sizes that seem to be concentrating on
orb in the arms of The Great One. Cast beneath him is a figure representing
all that is evil, grotesque and sickly. Placed in his arms is a piece of
animal fecal matter, around which the servants of the Lord of the Flies swarm.

The Entrance to The Community Hut ~
Crude beds of grass line the walls, making perfect homes for multitudes of
annoying insects. From beneath the floorboards a stench of waste rises up
to unsult your nostrils. You look down on their filth with disgust, even though
you haven't had a bath since you were seventeen. The walls are lined with the
the posessions of the occupents of this part of the hut. Beautiful cloth of
of many colors, bows, arrows, bowls stained by primitive paints -- the only
posessions of these simple people.

body. A pot boils in the corner with a bag of some leaves dangling from a
hook into it.

instantly as they are crused from the blow of the watter crashing into the

You wander the lake with little idea where you are going, let alone where you
are. Small fish swim around your feat splashing little droplets of water on
your feet. You have a nagging feeling that you are running around in a
wheel, getting nowhere fast.

On the banks of Lake Contnea ~
You stand on the south east shore of Lake Contnea. Little patches of green
grass grow amoungst the rock that makes up the shoreline. The lake looks so
beautiful from here, it almost seems as if it is calling you to it. You
stumble as you loose your balance from an unstable rock. This would
be a perfect place decend on the lake, if the jagged rock to the north were
not there, blocking the way.

East of a Cliff Face~
You are engulphed in what seems like a never-ending bank of fog. To the west
is a solid wall of rock, you guess granite, but of course you can and probably
are wrong. At times you begin to wonder if you will ever find the way onto the
island and if this isn't really a crule joke being plaied on you.

On Lake Contnea~
You wander aimlessly through endless amounts of water, the sun beating down
on you mercilessly. Reminded of a poem you mumble "water, water everywhere,
and not a drop to drink." The little fish taunt you by nibbling at your toes.

On a small island on Lake Contnea~
You stand on a small island somewhere on Lake Contnea. Small shrubbery
grows from the cracks in the rocks. One Larrge rock dominates the island,
with smaller, looser ones scattered about.
