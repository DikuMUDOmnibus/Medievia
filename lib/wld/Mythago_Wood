A Small Overgrown Path~
 The path before you seems to have been abandoned some time ago. Vines and
thick foliage brush against your skin and tear at your clothing. Above you the
trees form a canopy against the harsh elements. Stopping to catch your breath
for a moment, you notice an almost tangible silence.

A Small Overgrown Path~
 The path continues through the woods in an unpredictable pattern. The vines
and weeds here are less overgrown and you feel a slight breeze blowing from the
west. Judging by the flowers and garlands that adore the trees along the path
you assume this must be some sort of sacred way used less frequently than
before. You feel compelled to move on and explore what lies ahead of you.

A Small Overgrown Path~
 Your feet sink deep into muddy ground as you work your way through the tangle
of weeds and vines. The wind here is quite strong and refreshing, moving your
spirit to explore further. You see a shimmering surface ahead of you and you
can make out the tops of a beautiful range of moutains. You seemed to have
stumbled onto a beautiful, natural secluded area. Above you a Hawk flys in
circles, riding the gentle wind current.

The Glade of Serenity~
 You step out of the tangle into a open lake, surrounded by huge mountains. The
wind seems odd here, picking up now and then to lightly caress your face,
blowing your hair back in gentle gusts and whistling softly in your ears. The
area is flooded with the scent of patchouli leaves, tickling your neck and face
with fragrant kisses.

Dark, Dense Forest~
Day turns to night as you enter a dense woodland forest. The air around
you smells of earth, and a slight mist seems to brush against your skin.
Around you is a forest of old growth trees, towering high above you. Vines
and branches obscure your view in all directions. Even the light above you
struggles to break through the growth. You feel an odd calm sweep over
you, and your vision seems acute to every detail around you. The colors
are brighter, the trees more majestic, the scent of earth fills your
nostrils. You forget all about the meadow...

Mythago Wood~
You find yourself deep within the huge forest that is the Mythago Wood.
Not much sunlight reaches through the several layers of foliage above you.
Looking about cautiously, you hear a low moaning sound and a deep growling
that seems to be coming from the very trees that surround you completely on
all sides.  The closeness of your surroundings begins to grate on your senses
and you begin to feel a slight sensation of claustraphobia.  You glance down
at your feet and are astonished to see a slight mist swirling gently around
the lower half of your body.

Walking along the trail you smell the faint odor of death and decay, and
looking carefully at the ground you see a well overgrown path leading
to the west.  Looking back to the beginning of the trail to the north, you
are surprised and horrified to see that it is completely blocked now by
a row of gigantic oaks that were not there before, and how they got there,
you cannot imagine.

You are startled to find that you are in a clearing in the woods.  You
breathe in deeply and take a long good look at the sky, something you
have not seen for quite some time now.  Your sense of relief is shattered
however, when you see a hulking blackened monolith in the center of the
clearing. Approaching it, you notice the outline of a door carved into
the rock.  All of your senses scream for you to turn the other way and
run, but the power curiousity is very great indeed...

Secured around each post is a drape of black velvet. Placed in various places
on the floor are several soft, hand-woven rugs. Along the walls are many
tapestries, each depicting a different scene of unique and exquisite detail.
Moving your gaze upward you see a dome ceiling. Looking back at you, is the
painted image of a young maiden with the crown of a queen. On each side is a
man, one with the crown of a King, the other dressed in a full suit of armor.
The Queen's blue eyes penetrate into your soul, leaving you with an odd sense

heightened and you notice any slight movement around you.
Bringing your gaze downward you notice laying in front of you

A Cascading Waterfall~
 The rush of the waterfall sends a refreshing mist of water against your skin.
The waterfall rushes down from some 20 feet up in a wall of white to a small
pool area below. The force of the waterfall has carved out a perfect circular
hole in the water just big enough for two. Judging from the gently clouds of
steam that arise from the pool you gather this must be some sort of hot spring.
Spotting a small ledge you sit down and hang your feet into the soothing
waters, just enough to let your sole's kiss the water's surface.

peeling and fading due to moisture and time. You feel an odd sense of security
here, encased in earth.

 Day turns to night as you enter a dense woodland forest. The air around you
smells of earth, and a slight mist seems to brush against your skin. Around you
is a forest of old growth trees, towering high above you. Vines and branches
obscure your view in all directions. Even the light above you struggles to
break through the growth. You feel an odd calm sweep over you, and your vision
seems acute to every detail around you. The colors are brighter, the trees more
majestic, the scent of earth fills your nostrils. You forget all about the
meadow... Moving your gaze from the trees you look ahead of you and are amazed
that you didn't see this before. It's a beautiful house, hidden by the
surrounding forest.

The stairs under you feet are soft and smooth. Looking closer
you notice that they are marbled of several stones, giving
them an overall rainbow effect. The walls on either side of you
are not walls at all, but instead a beautiful vertical garden.
Vines and small flowers of vibrant colors and various sizes grow
vertically up the walls, several of them glow softly, illuminating
your way.

An Octagon Room With a Glass Roof~
You are startled by the beauty of this room. Although it was made by human
hands, it overflows with magic. The floor is entirely crafted of plates of
stone. Each plate carefully laid to absorb the surrounding energy. The roof
is made out of glass, and you have a perfect view of the phases of the moon.
During the day, sun shines through the pattern of the glass, sending a
beautiful display of prisms.

Inside a Two-man Tent~
 You sit inside a cute little two-man tent. The tent is in the shape of a dome,
with a little hole at the top for late-nite star gazing. The bottom of the tent
is acutally soft, laid on a pile of pine needles. Hanging from the top of the
tent is a small candle to light the tent at night.

Soft, Moss-Covered Ground~
The ground here is a blanket of colorful lichen and moss. Little purple
flowers peek out here and there that exhale into the air an almost
intoxicating aroma. The sun shines warmly on your head, and the wind blows
softly against your skin. Surrounding this area on all sides are tall,
beautiful trees. You see what looks to be a small path, overgrown with vines
and plant life. Maybe this is a good place for a short nap before you journey
onward.

Mythago Wood~
You find yourself deep within the huge forest that is the Mythago Wood.
Not much sunlight reaches through the several layers of foliage above you.
Looking about cautiously, you hear a low moaning sound and a deep growling
that seems to be coming from the very trees that surround you completely on
all sides.  The closeness of your surroundings begins to grate on your senses
and you begin to feel a slight sensation of claustraphobia.  You glance down
at your feet and are astonished to see a slight mist swirling gently around
the lower half of your body.

Mythago Wood~
You are lost...deep within the Mythago Wood.  The silence that surrounds you
begins to weigh upon your mind, and your imagination begins to conjure up
visions and sounds of the worst nightmares that have been churning around
in your poor tormented soul.  Your mind snaps into reality as you hear a low
rumbling sound and see an uprooted tree to the east.

Mythago Wood~
You find yourself standing before a huge, fallen tree that lies in your
path. Inspecting it carefully, you see evidence of unnatural damage that
has been inflicted upon the tree near its roots.  Huge scars and furrows
have been left in the bark, and the thought of something having that the
strength cause this much destruction curdles your blood.  The most frightening
thing is...you see a drop of fresh sap trickle out of one of the tree's
wounds. Whatever did this might not be that far away...

Mythago Wood~
Although you are still clearly in the Mythago Wood, you feel a strange
sensation. The air around you crackles with the aura of power and you see
a long overgrown trail leading south.  The urge to run away from this place
is overwhelming, but the excitement you feel more than overcomes it.
Something is drawing you towards this path...something primal, and integral
to your very being.

The trees part, revealing a beautiful glade filled with tall
green grass and beautiful wild flowers.  The meadow is covered by a delicate
canopy of queen anne's lace and is carpeted by soft clover.  The soft music
of busy honey bees draws you out of the dark wood, into the warm sunlight.

A path less taken~
You notice this smaller path leading north from the main road.  Not knowing
where it leads, you look around for a signpost or some indication of who may
have travelled this way.  You see nothing that gives any hint of what lies
beyond the next hillock, but something about the way the grass blows in the
breeze, and the way clouds dance along the sky, makes you impetuously decide
to leave the road to the east, and continue northward.

A path less taken~
You pass over the crest of the hill and look with curiosity to the other
side.  Ahead is a dark wood and from this vantage point you can see it
stretches on for many leagues.  The scene is dark and forboding.  The trees
are dense and twitsted so that little light penetrates to the forest floor.
You are spooked by several ungodly sounds and can't decide whether one is
an owl screetching, or a human scream.  Then you notice the huge willow
ahead.  It is very big and old.  Its long green branches reach to the
ground in a comforting way, like an old grandfather.  It looks like a good
place to rest before you begin your journey back to the city.

A Spiral stair case crafted of a dark
wood. It looks to have been carved to
resemble vines and leaves twisting
upward. The stairs look to be of a
deep green stone.

The Forest of Desire~
 Stepping through the mirror, you find yourself in the center of an ancient
redwood grove. A feeling of envelopment overcomes you, standing beneath the
towering forty foot trees. The rythmic sound of heavy raindrops falling from
the high branches calm your mind, into a trancelike state of peacefulness. A
small family of deer frolic in the distance, plucking dream berries off a
nearby bush. The sweet smell of jasmine and amber drift from an incense plate
in the center of the table. Four enormous mushrooms grow around the stump,
making perfect chairs.
