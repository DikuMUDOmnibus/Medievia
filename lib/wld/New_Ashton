Along the Southern Wall~
You're travelling along a dirt path that hugs the wall to the south.  As you
begin to enter this charming village you notice that almost all the buildings
appear to be slapped together very quickly, not taking much thought to design.
To the north stands the food complex with every store necessary for your
consumption needs.

This complex ends a little to the west then the path turns to the north.  You
see a mother and child exit the bakery with a freshly baked loaf of bread in
their hands.  Smells good!

To the right and left are small merchant complexs with a small watchtower
inside each.  The path beneith you is now begining to solidify into an almost

The water flowing is much louder under these clay walls.  As you look to the
ground you can see that water has splashed to the lavaearth and is trickling
down into the ground.  Over a period of time the constant flow of water would
surely loosen the ground.

Narcissa Road (Dead End)~
Travelling along the road you spot the jeweller's shop and meditation room to
the north.  The light that shines through the window sparkles through the
crystal and various gems in the case by the window.  To the west the wall turns
to the north and prevents you from going any further.

The Public Post Office of Ashton~
In front of you is an interesting box with various buttons marked "Send" and
Receive on them.  It appears to be an automated postal machine (APM).  It must
be imported because it's way too advanced for this town's technology.  You can
hear the hum of the ATM below you.

The Old Western Gate~
You stand before the Old Western Gate which used to be a magnficant gateway into
New Ashton. The elders of the city decided to weld the gate shut because a
cult of citizens believe that one day The Mount will destroy the city. The cult
is located in the North-West section of town. The wall takes a turn to the
east here and follow Hickory Road. The new western gate is now located in
City Hall square.

filled section of town with many merchants and peasants bustling about.  The
centerpiece of the Square is of course, the City Hall.  It is by far the most
developed building in the entire city.  The tall spire looks almost as tall as
The Mount behind it.  The entire City Hall building is built above the ground
which allows for people to walk underneith it.

Swords and Sharps~
If a small child were to wander in here, you'd have some lawsuits comming!
Every inch of this room is filled with some sort of killing device of every
shape and size.  In the back of the room is a counter displaying some of the
more expensive items.

The Prophet's Manifesto:
by Anonymous
------------------------
We, the belivers that the world as we know it will cease to exist after the
4th day in the Month of Yar (Ashtonian Calander), have formed a society to
discuss our concerns.  We will not be taken lightly!  Every night at sunset
we will meet here to discuss our concerns.  Thank you.

The Slaughter House~
Watch where you step in this place, you might hit a squishy piece of cow!
Blood and guts are splattered all over this place, the fact that you want
to buy something to EAT from here turns your stomach.

A Small Hole Through The Lava~
As you wiped away the lava you uncovered a hollow section of the lavaearth.
Looking down you can feel the heat from the lava begining to seep up.  The
walls are lined with a fine layer of ash and are begining to get hot to the
touch. You can't see more than 3 feet below you.

Central Square~
Falling out of the lava you've come acrossed an amazing discovery.  You've
stumbled upon a deserted town much like the one you just came from.  In fact
almost everything looks the same with only one difference: the sky.  It doesn't
exist, instead it's a shield of lava covering the town for miles.  In the
distance you can see the lava slope down to the ground enclosing this town
in a lava dome.

Close to the Summit~
The top of The Mount is now less than 10 meters away.  However there's still
a long way to go.  There's a small ledge to the east of here.

A Very Small Ledge~
Unfortunatly this ledge is not as big as you thought it was.  And also, you
have some unwelcomed company here too.  The ledge of the top of The Mount is
just about one meter above your head.

You've reached your goal.  It's so hot and steamy up here that you can't see
below to the ground.  The rim is about a meter and a half wide.  Ahead of you

The Lava Churning Depths of The Mount~
You can feel your armor begin to melt in these firey depths.  The extreme heat
in here won't let you last long.  Wading in the lava you can feel the seizmic
waves push you up and down while trying to concentrate on surviving.

The Eruptor's Gate~
Traveling along this passageway you've hit a snag.  You've run into an old
gate that has been rusted from the moisture from the volcano.  The gate has
some sort of futuristic locking device that is attached to the sides of the
walls. If you can't figure it out, there are some nice guards here you can
ask.

Keep of the Great Eruptor~
This room is unlike any other room in the city.  In the center is a massive
devise that has a large pipe filled with lava that flows up to the volcano.
At one side of the room is a laboratory with many jars and sealed bottles
resting on a shelf.   At the other side is a small bed and a bookcase filled
with books from Ashton City's past.  The wizard is not happy at all to see you.

Inside Some Glowing Lava~
Digging through the soft pile of ash you've come across a hollow section of
the ground.  The sides of this small hollow cavern seem to be glowing with an
energy force you can't identify.  Looking down you can see a large drop
to another plane.

South Gate of New Ashton~
Before you stands the majestic city of New Ashton.  The ground you're standing
on is made of small, soft rocks.  The air smells of sulfur and other earthly
scents. To the east and west runs a high wall made of sandstone.  In front of
you is a cobble path that leads towards a large building made of hardened
clay. As you look up from the ground you see the massive volcano, simply
called "The Mount" by the citizens.  It looks incredibly fierce and yet right
now its in its dormant phase.
