A Dimly Lit House~
You have entered a spacious, one room house.  Thick curtains have been
pulled across all the windows, letting in only thin streams of light.
Bookcases line most of the wall space, tables and workbenches occupy
much of the floor.  An unmade bed sits in the northwest corner near
a large, blackened-stone fireplace.  Burning candles have been set
randomly on whatever surface hasn't been cluttered with books and
papers and alchemy equipment.

The room is quite spacious and made entirely of stone.  A large hearth
burns brightly in the eastern wall, heating the area.  Thick rugs made
of bear and deer hide cover the hardwood floor and hang from the walls.
Large foot lockers made of iron and copper line the walls.

A Narrow Alley~
This is a very narrow alleyway between several buildings.  The stone walls
of the two story buildings rise on the east and west.  No windows face
into the alley.  The cobblestone ground is covered with grime and
garbage is piled up on either side of the alley.

A Dead-End~
A narrow alley from the south has opened up into this ten by ten foot
courtyard. Tall stone walls of buildings rise up to the north, east
and west.  No windows face into this courtyard.  Garbage and debris
clutter the area, stacked high against the walls.  A large crate stands
against the northern wall.

A Shadowy Hideout~
A narrow ladder attached to the east wall leads down into this damp
room. It is approximately thirty feet square and made of stone,
obviously not by a skilled craftsman.  The air is musty and their are
only a few candles to light the room, casting flickering shadows.
Stores of provisions and weapons, as well as other equipment needed
for outdoor survival are stacked along the southern wall.  A large
group of men, some dressed in armor, sit with their backs to the
walls discussing in hushed tones.

Atop a Stone Pillar~
You are perched on a massive stone pillar, apparently carved from black
granite. It is approximately ten feet in diameter and twenty feet tall.
Stretching out in all directions below you in a thriving town.  Beyond
the walls of the city is a vast forest.  A staircase, blending into the side
of the pillar, leads down to the town square.

Town Square~
This is a large, open square in the center of town.  The ground is paved
with worn down cobblestones.  The surrounding buildings are made mostly
from heavy timber and brick, and a few of the more prominent buildings
are constructed of stone and marble.  Wide, heavily used streets lead in
each of the four cardinal directions.
In the center of the square is an immense pillar of black granite.  Steps
have been carved into the sides, spiraling upward twenty feet to the top.
Arcane runes are etched into the pillar's surface and filled with molten
silver.

The Adventurers' Guild~
From the looks of your surroundings, you are in a large, one-room building.
The floor is polished hardwood and the walls are a combination of brick
and roughly finished stones.  Several tables and many chairs have been
placed all around the room.  Various maps are pinned to the walls,
displaying the city and surrounding areas.  Open doorways provide exits to
the east and south.  In the northwest corner of the room, you notice an
open trapdoor in the floor.

This street is very wide, enough so that two carts could pass each other

and flowering trees, beyond which lies the city wall.  It is nearly twenty
feet tall and constructed of massive granite blocks.  Buildings and houses
stand to the east on the other side of the walkway.

Training Hall of the Warrior Arts~
This building would be better described as four walls surrounding a
courtyard. Practice dummies have been set up to train warriors in the
skills of various weapons.  In the center of the courtyard is enough
room to hold a joust, and you wouldn't be surprised if that has happened
in the past.

You are walking through the underbrush surrounding the walls of New
Genesia. The town's wall is to the north, only a few feet away.  It
is constructed entirely from huge blocks of granite, fitted together
almost seamlessly.  Upon closer inspection of the wall, you can see
jagged pieces of glass protruding from the seams.  This would deter
almost any thief from attempting to scale these walls.  To the south
lies farm land and small cottages.
