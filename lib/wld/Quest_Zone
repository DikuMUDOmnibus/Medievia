[Eldar War Room]~
This room is constructed from the same bone white material that the
rest of the complex is made from, with the exception of the gems set into
the walls and irregular interviels. There is a large table in the middle of
the room that glows. There is a large glowing map set against the eastern
wall with many different spots of light on it. The map looks like a
representation of Trellor, with the city outlined. All the clan halls are
marked, and two of them have been blacked out. There is a door to your east,
and to the west.

The base of the lost cliffs.~
You stand at the base of cliffs that have been roughly hewn out of
living obsidian.  A small trail winds upward to the west disappearing from
view as it as it curves northward.

gearing up for a war. There are no children present. In the middle of the
room is a black platform with a box with a glowing outline of a hand set
on a pole next to the actual platform. The ceiling rises 30 feet, and the walls
are all made from the same bone white material as the rest of the base. There
are about twenty of the floating globes of light.

[Eldar Holding Cell]~
You enter the room cautiously, peering into the dank, ugly and
dark confines.  The stench of long years of imprisonment fills
your nostrils, giving you a sense of the long, ponderous hours
spent here by those trapped here.  Suddenly, the door through
which you came slams shut.  It is only now that you notice a
skeleton lying deep in the dark corner.  Remains of armor
encircle it, the bones seeming to turn to dust as you stare.
Fear and dispare grip you as you slowly begin to realize that
the thick walls will muffle your cries for help.  Like
the poor soul in the corner, you are trapped, eternally.

Non-descript cave mouth~
Before you is a non-descript cave mouth. If not for some hidden instinct
telling you to look this way, you would have passed by with nary a glance.
Parting the shrubs before the mouth of the cave you can see evidence of
recent movement in and out of the cave.
As you continue into the interior, you come across a door standing hundreds
of feet high and tens of feet wide. The door is made from plain black stone
and is featureless except for a small keyhole. Should you turn back now...or
continue ahead.

There is but one floating globe of light in this room, making it rather
gloomy. You can make out in the dim light 8 beds in this room. Next to each
bed there is a obsidian locker, and a small desk made out of the same material

Kaela Mensha Khaine, the old god of the Eldar now driven into a
fragmented exile in the material plane. The Avatar sits as still as a
statue of ancient metal, pitted with age and encrusted with the patina
of corrosion. The chamber that surround the throne is built of gleaming
wrathbone whose skeletal structure stretches throughout this entire base.

RE: Base Beta
.
All personel, will be prepared to move out to the new base in 5 weeks. Our
wraithbone singers will be done by then. Our defeat at Trellor has pushed
back the invasion plans. We need to regroup and re-plan. We will be
victorious over the humans. Our human spy Kyleel Underwood informs us that
the main of the populace is ignorant of our plans. Let's keep it that way.

Fairone's Bedroom~
 The sweet smell of perfume entices you as you enter the room. Gazing around
you see a huge round bed in its center, curtained in a sheer luminous material
with a dark red silk duvet and several white silk feather pillows. The wall to
the west is gone and offers an enchanting view of a beautiful valley of
flowers. The dome ceiling is covered in lovely murals of flying dragons,
unicorns and nymphs all with a background of a dark starlit sky. The south wall
is of mirrors and has several mirrored doors, leading to a large wardrobe. The
east wall is covered in a huge tapestry of the finest silk. One last thing
catches your eye...there is a small sphere floating in the corner hovering
there and suspended by magic.

Wardrobe~
 Never in your life have you seen so many clothes in on place. One entire wall
has nothing but shoes placed in neat little racks and arranged by color. There
is a huge dressing table on one wall with several bottles of exotic perfumes
and a small plague sitting in the middle. The rest of the walls contain nothing
but lovely dresses of every color you can imagine and then some are of colors
that you just can't place and have never seen before. In the very center of the
room there is a huge round tub with candles and small vial of bathing beads and
salts placed on its rim.
