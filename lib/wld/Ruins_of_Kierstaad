A Narrow Path Through the Weeds~
 As you walk along the path you notice with each step you take the mansion is
much larger than you thought. You also notice the air of decay and desertion
surrounding you. One whole wing of the masion has been ravaged by fire, leaving
only masonry and charred timbers. Even the landscape around you seems lifeless,
devoid of trees and bristling with rank weeds.

A Narrow Path Through the Weeds~
 The mansion looms over you like a heavy weight on your shoulders. You notice
that the mansion is three stories tall, the bottom story recessed five or six
feet. Five broad corbled stone arches support the overhang. A yard-wide chunk
of stone and plaster has fallen from the middle arch.

Before The Mansion~
 The path has led you to the central arch of the mansion. A dark oak door set
into the wall beneath has been decorated with two carved mirror-image whorls
occupying the top and bottom frames, surrounded by intertwining serpents. Two
bronze lanterns jutt out from the stone beside the door, their glasswork broken
and jagged. To each side of the door are bricked-up windows, and beyond them
more alcoves in the stone walls.

A Large and Long-abandoned Kitchen~
 As you step inside the kitchen your feet kick up great black wafts of
felt-like dust. Yard-wide iron pots and brick-based stoves and ovens fill a
chamber of at least 70 feet long and 60 feet wide. Everything smells of old
spilled wine and dusty decay. A stream of light struggles to make it's way
through a long, narrow horizontal window about twelve feet above the floor on
the opposite wall. Apparently the kitchen is in a kind of basement, from the
front it lays below ground level. To your north a white enameled metal door
hangs ajar on corroded hinges, revealing only darkness within.

A Small Stairwell~
 You stand near the bottom a small stairwell that leads to the lower levels of
the mansion where the kitchen and other basic necessities lay. A thick layer of
dust coats the stairs, marked only by tiny footprints of rodents, obviously
this section of the manor is not used often. A wretched odor comes from the
room below but, it is far to dark to see what exactly is causing the smell.

The Dining Hall~
Three long dark wood tables fill about half the space, chairs upended neatly
on the table edges. A stained and musty carpet gives way to wooden flooring
beyond the tables. The room could hold a respectable size ball-stretching to
the front of the house where tall arched windows afforded a view of the rising
sun. The light struggles through the windows, casting smeared silvery-grey
across the table tops. The rooms smells of dust and and rather bitter tang of
flowers.

Modern, overstuffed couches have been spaced along the walls between
more tall arched windows. A demolished piano clutters a nearby stage. At the
opposite end of the foyer is an immense staircase, with gold banisters mounted
on turned pillars of ebony. A balistrade runs from the staircase across the
length of the upper landing.

A beautiful painting has been mounted here on the wall. It shows a young
maiden sitting amongst a field of beautiful wild flowers. Yet, something is odd
about the picture, perhaps it's the snow falling lightly around her, or maybe
it's her ice cold blue eyes that chill your soul. Whatever it is you feel a
distinct uneasiness when gazing upon this strange painting.

A Burnt, Destroyed Hallway~
 The smell of sulfur is dulled somewhat here by an overwhelming odor of decay
that fills the air. Double doors leading to the dinning hall, once strong and
sturdy lay on the ground here, little more the pieces of burnt cinder. The heat
generated from the fire was intense enough to even melt the brass door handles.

A Burnt, Destroyed Hallway~
 This section of the hall lays in ruin, paintings and tapestries that once hung
proudly on the walls now lay on the ground in bits and pieces of burnt ruin.
The strong odor of sulfur fills the otherwise musty hall, almost to the point
of overpowering your senses. From the amount of damage done to this section of
the mansion it is amazing that whatever disaster struck here did not consume
the whole house.

 You stand in the middle of a long, dark hallway. Just north of here the strong
scent of sulfur is quite strong. Scorched marks line the once finely polished
wooden floors, as if a once great fire burned its way through this section of
the mansion. To the east you see a small archway that leads to a large library
that despite the burnt marks on the doorway, appears to have been unaffected by
whatever disaster happened here.

 The maze twists and turns around you in an unpredictable pattern of disorder

The Room of Shadows~
 You walk into a giant, circular room illuminated by hundreds of soft golden
flames. All around you tall, black candles throw shadows across the walls. As
you stand here slightly dazed by the candle-light, the shadows on the wall
begin to transform into beautiful, dancing spirits. As you watch their erotic,
dark dance of magic, they swirl, spiraling upward merging into one, dark form.

An Elaborate Bedroom~
 You push aside thick spider webs and step inside a rather large bed chamber.
Hanging on the walls around you are a collection of rather disturbing
tapestries of dark, ancient beauty. Against the far wall is a large canopy bed,
draped with black velvet curtains. A small table sits near the bed with a
bouquet of withered, dead roses. Everything in the room is covered with a thin
layer of dust. You smell that faint scent of sweet jasmine fill the air,
encircling your body.

instead sharp talons. She has a long flowing black tail and soft, grey feathers
cover her head. Encircling the ankles and calves of the human woman are
beautiful, intricate tatoos of flowering vines.

A Dusty Path Through the Vineyard~
 As you step through the gate, a fierce wind picks up, blowing it's cold breath
over your body. Surveying the field before you shows what once was a beautiful
vineyard now is overgrown with dry shrub. The vines have died, leaving thick
grey stumps tethered to stakes tilting crazily in dirt crusted with crisp, sere
dead leaves. Looking further in the distance you notice the rear of a blocky
retangular mansion emerging from the mist and shadows...

The Library~
 You stand in an old musty library. Huge bookcases made of the finest yew
surround you, spiraling far up to ceiling above. An odd assortment of ancient
tomes line each of the bookshelves, most covered in a thick layer of dust from
lack of use. An old, antique desk, covered with numerous parchments and scrolls
sits in the corner of the library, it too lays covered in a thick layer of dust
as if someone simply got up from working and never returned. A long stairwell
fashioned from shiny black stone leads to the upper levels of the library. It
has been poorly maintained and has lost much of its original luster.

fashioned from a dark blue leather binding that almost seems to glow, filling
the room with a soft blue light.

An Old Courtyard~
Right in the center of the Vineyard, is an old courtyard surrounded by wild
desertion and neglect. All around you are stone fountains, benches, and statues
tangled in rank weeds and undergrowth. The sounds around you seem at once to
die away, leaving a hollow silence broken only by the wind rustling through the
tall dead weeds. Rearing up ahead of you, is the mansion with it's dark wings,
oddly resembling a colossal hound, crouched and ready to spring.

 A chaotic mosaic of jagged, colored shards of glass make up a window at least
nine feet tall. The sunlight streams through the nightmarish stained-glass
window forming a writhing pattern of images. Looking closely at the window you
notice that there is a man clad in a coat of black velvet and golden breeches.
A red ribbon ties back his long raven-dark hair. The portrait is exquisitely
done, and the tiny fragments of glass render his gave, handsome features
perfectly.

A Circular Altar of White Pillars~
 A deep, persuasive silence overwhelms you and embraces the entire area with
solitude. Unlike the decay and death that embodies the Mansion, you feel like
you have stepped into another place and time far away from that chaotic realm.
You stand in the center of a beautiful, flourishing garden. The altar has been
crafted from a marbled white stone set in a circular pattern of white pillars.
The top of the altar is covered with a metal latice design that you can look
through, past the darkening sky into the dominions of stillness and grace.
Gentle moonbeams bathe the area in a silver fluid grace that seem to stop the
hand of time with their magic. Deep purple vines spiral and encircle the
pillars and small wild black roses cover the ground. But what draws your
attention the most is standing in the center of the altar...a statue of a woman
who's beauty surpasses the natural beauty around you with a profound
sacredness.

 Despite the overall neglect of the mansion, this room has managed to retain

while slightly dulled, still retain most of their shiny luster. An archway,
near the western end of the ballroom lead outside onto a balcony.

The Gate of Kierstaad~
 A feeling of panic rushes through you as you find yourself standing before a
black iron gate that towers at least twenty feet above you. The very air around
you weighs heavy on your soul and a feeling of dread that you cannot quite
place whispers of secrets long forgotten. Placing your hands lightly on the
cold black iron you feel pain and love resonate through your body. Spiraling up
and around the gate are beautiful deep purple vines that strangle and choke off
the wild flowers that grow nearby. Beyond the gate lies a gloomy darkness that
hoovers around you, threatening to consume you. Along each side of the gate is

To your north towers a black iron gate blocking any attempts at
moving forward. You notice in the center of the gate is a detailed
carving of the figure of a beautiful woman. Wrapped around her body
are the wings of an angel, veiling her face from view. The iron bars
seem to portray her eternal prison.
