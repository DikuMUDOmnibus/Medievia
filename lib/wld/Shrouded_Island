Pier~
This is what remains of a once huge pier and docks.  The wood has rotted
beyond any realm of safety and you step lightly to avoid falling through.
You look down into the water and see more than one wreckage of what used
to be the grand fleet of Kippurnia.

Boardwalk~

This was once a grand boardwalk where many people would wait in eager
anticipation for the arriving ships and the goods they carried.

Large tables and strange instruments fill this rather small building.  No sign

a new owner.  Huge thick strands of webbing cover the back wall and the

upon you.

The huge oaken bar stretching from one side of the room to the other tells
you that this must have been the town pub.  You think you can almost hear the
laughter and singing from the crowds of sailors and townspeople that once
gathered here.  Then you realize the laughter is real, and those sailors, or
what's left of them, are still here, and they don't look happy at your
intruding upon their reminiscence.

This was once a grand house here in this peacefull town, now the walls are
covered in seaweeds and strange bones.  Unusual tribal markings cover the
floors and black candles illuminate the stairway to the second floor.  As you
look towards the stairs you notice for the first time the wierd lisping chant
comming from that direction.  It begins to get louder, and you wonder just how
wise it was coming here.

As you step onto the creaking timbers you begin to wonder just how old this
drawbridge is.  You cringe as something moves the thick layer of scum covering
the moat below you.  You glance at the rotted boards between you and whatever
that was and hope you will not be finding out any time soon.  Another step
brings you through the darkness, an eerie greyish light casts it's glow down
from a tower window illuminating a once grand castle.

through the timbers leaving the bodies crumpled up on the ground.  The wind
is calm yet the corpses continue to sway as if still alive.  As you leave you

You shudder and move on.

Spiral Staircase~
OK here is your new zone! Take your time, make me proud. Most of all Have Fun!
The commands are basic.  Makeroom makes rooms. Saveroom will save whole zone,
or use saveroom <zonenumber>. Use ll or listzone to find out the zone
number.  makeroom e  will make a room east, a DIRECT copy of this one.
makeroom e 10  will make 10 rooms east DIRECT copy, like a Fast hallway
editroom is the MAIN command.  Type editroom(ENTER) for a list of options.
makeexit n 1234  will connect this room north to room 1234.  All doors must
be edited on both sides.  Please be VERY careful when making rooms as they
are a bitch to delete.  The MOST IMPORTANT time saving thing is to set the
first room up(this one) with all the proper sector type, flags, restrictions,
etc.  Because all rooms will be copied from this one, it will save you a
lotta time later.  PLEASE make sure all rooms that are inside have a sector
type of inside and a flag of inside (Vryce hates when it rains indoors).
ALSO DO THIS, restrict this room to level 32.  THE WHOLE zone will be
restricted to level 32 until it is opened to the public, when I use a command
to unrestrict the whole zone in one shot.  Any questions, ask any level 35.
Have a blast, work when in the mood, think it out, make a lotta hidden rooms,
look ats and custom entrance/exit text when it will add UMPH to the room.

This climb seems like forever.  The handholds are getting dryer as you

Guard Post~
Four armed and armored skeletons lie here.  They had erected some sort of
barracade, now little more than some rotted boards.  You see that these men
unlike so many in the rest of the castle had time to prepare.  It is only
then that you realize there is no sign of an enemy.  No weapons, no bodies
nothing.

did the man who was using it little good.  A destroyed room is to the east,
it seems to open to the outside.  The hallway ahead looks as if it deadends
as the destruction becomes complete.

mosaic floor tile~
This mosaic is in three parts.  The first part shows the king sitting at his
throne with what looks like a council of some sort sitting to either side of
him.  The next section is of a large room with dozens of men they appear to
be casting ballots as one of them stands at a podium in front.  The last
scene is that of six men and one woman dressed in black robes.  They sit
behind a long table as they listen to a little boy standing by his mother.
You can not understand all of the images but you being to wonder if these
all have something to do with governmental methods.

What is left of the weapons that lie here seem to be of a style you have

all but rotted away, old glassware some still intact have fallen all around
the room.  Your eyes take in all the destruction, for it was here that the
explosion that destroyed most of the castle came from.
It is just then that you see what must have caused this explosion, hovering
in the center of the room above what looks like the remains of a large alter
is a huge swirling mist.  It pulsates and throbs like a dying heart as you
approach.  You can feel the evil seep into your bones as it's grey light falls
upon you; perhaps you should leave.

was held here.  One skeletal form lies broken in the cernter of the room, a
strangely curved blade grasped in his hand.  It is clear by the wreckage that
this man fought to the end with bravery and honour, taking many of his
enemies with him.  A large portrait hangs from the far wall over what seem to
be mounts for some sort of weapon, perhaps the curved blade grasped in the
dead mans hand.

A small alter stands broken in two against the far wall.  Horrible markings
have been scrawled all across the room as if to defile this once holy place.
Only then do you notice the skeletal remainds of what must have been the
cleric who resided here.  The bones themselves have been pierced by some sort
of hooks that fasten the skeleton to the sealing.  The richly embroidered
robes hanging in such a way that it seems like the body is still thrashing
as a breese blows them.
Whoever, or whatever did this must have had an inhuman capacity for hatred
and violence.

Map Room~
Tattered parchment coveres the walls here.  What seem to have been large
oceanagraphic maps lie strewn across a large table dominating the center
of the room.  An old decrepit desk sits in the corner.

Royal Hall~
This is the hallway containing all the royal compartments.  The royal
bedroom lies to the west, the queens sitting room to the east and
the kings private study to the north. The walls are richly decorated
with now very old tapistries and murals.

King Thoril's Private Study~
This was a rather modest room where the king went to collect his thoughts
or just catch up on some paperwork with a good cup of tea.  Despite the
thick layers of dust, you can clearly see that this room was once kept
immaculately clean.  A small closet door is to the west.

Royal Chambers~
This is where the king and queen of this once great nation called home.
They must have not been in here when the destruction hit, because the beds
are made and other than dust, it looks as if they could walk in at any
moment.

Queen Elemyr's Sitting Room~
This is where the beloved queen of Kippurnia spends her free time.
A large loom stands in the corner, surrounded by plush chairs and carpets.
In the corner you see a skeleton clad in a richly embroidered dress, on the
wall is something scrawled in blood.  It looks as if the queen died here
trying to pass on one last message to her subjects.

near a cleanly kept campfire.  It looks like he is out once again searching
new lands.
