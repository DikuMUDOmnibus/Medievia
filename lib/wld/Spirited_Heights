In the drive shaft!~
You realize immediately upon entering the shaft what a poor idea is was... Your
cloak catches on the spinning drive, and pulls you to it.  You are able to
withstand the spinning for just a few seconds before you red-out.  After a
brief period, it feels as if the spinning has stopped.   It is very dark. You
hear the lone cry of the desolate as you realize you have died.

On a ladder up the side of the driveshaft~
The ladder is shaking from whatever is going on inside the drive shaft.  You
can hear the shaft spinning wildly within the tower, and it sounds as it it may
fall loose from whatever holds it.  BAM!  The whole tower shakes myseteriously!
You can proceed farther up and down the ladder.

There is a small opening in the wall of the tower you could squeeze though
if you wanted to, but your common sense urges you not to do it as the sounds
which are coming from the shaft suggest that there are probably many pieces of
hard iron whizzing around which could crack your skull open and splatter your
brains from here to the Asnor Mountains.

The passageway here is about four feet wide, and the ravine's walls rise sharply
to the east and north.  There is a small ammount of water flowing on the rock
floor here, coming from the west and flowing into the ravine to the south.  The
ground is covered with a slippery black algae.

End of the ravine~
The ravine comes to an end here, and the walls become dramatically less steep.
About two inches of water flows on the ground here, coming from the north, and
flowing to the east.  There is a narrow passageway up the cliff here, an even
narrower passage to the north, and the eastern exit heads back down the
mountain.

An impassible cliff~
The butte comes down here quickly, making an impassible cliff to the south. To
the east, the terrain drops off just as quickly, and to the west, there is a
ledge which looks just barely large enough to traverse.  An ancient snag stands
here, its roots just barely holding it upright in the rocky soil.  The snag has
several holes in it, though, and it appears that you may climb it upwards.

many trees.  You suspect that this this tree, seemingly growing out of the bare
rock cliff, was the father of all the trees below you.  You suspect that you
may be able to sneak up the side of the tree.

In a narrow crack in the cliff~
 You are at the bottom of a crack which runs from here to the top of the bluff.
Judging by the texture and color of the rock here, it seems like the crack was
made quite recently by some cataclysmic event. The fissure is about 2 feet wide
here, making it possible to snake your way a bit higher. About 7 feet straight
out from the cliff it the top of an old rotting snag. It could probably be
reached with a swift leap to the south and a bit of luck.

This ancient but sturdy obersevation point stands at the southernmost point

gently over some high hills and then falls to a swampy lowland just before the
a town-like area.  To the north, you can see the high forest slope gently back
down to Medievia.  The land around Medievia is flat and well developed.  West
of the city, you can see several sububan areas, and to the north, a graveyard
spreads out.  Looking southwest, you can see the Port of Medievia and the
ocean shores.  Straight to the south, it is too dark to see anything...  A
large shadow cast from the base of the Butte extends, blackening everything in
its path. The only point of detail is a large red stone rising from the trees.

there is a large deposit of a silty sand...  In wetter seasons, a creek coming
from the east seemingly ends right here, leaving a small sand bar.  The clearest
path through the forest is straight south.

The mouth of a cave~
You find yourself in a very small cave. It comes to a dead end in all
directions. In the center of the cave, there is a hole from which a large
amount of air is coming. The wind is cold and wet. The rock on which
you stand on closer inspection seems to be more like a ceiling than a floor.
The rock is only a few inches thick where the hole goes down, and you feel
uneasy even standing here. You can' see anything graspable beneath the rim,
and you' probably fall a great distance and impale yourself on a stalagmite if
you tried to head down here. Better find another entrance to the cave. A
VERY important sign is here.

grow from the rock here, but they certainly don't look very healthy.

Atop a small rock pinnacle~
You are above the tops of the trees here, and the presence of so much light
makes you suddenly realize exactly how dark the forest is.  To the west, you
can see out over the high forest area.  The tops of the trees are thick and
make a very effective blanket over the area.  The Butte is also visible to
the northwest.  From here, you can finally make out some vague detail about
the top of it.  Through the haze, the silhouette of a large castle suggests
itself, wicked and powerful.  From the base of the butte, in a line heading
mostly south, lies the edge of the shadow from the butte.  Where the shadow
falls upon the forest, the trees look cold and inhibited.  An occasional
bird is seen in the air here, but rarely over the shadow.  To the far, far,
west, a thin horizontal line of a light green tinge seems to mark the
western edge of the shadow.

At the top of the cavern~
An old iron staircase intersects with and old iron grid catwalk here.  The
staircase leaves up into a small hole in the ceiling of the cavern, and the
catwalk leaves north into darkness.  The sound of water slamming thunderously
against rock fills the cave, and beneath that sound, you can here a more gentle
sound of water lapping at the edges of the cavern.

The catwalk is rusty from the moist air here, and feels as if it might very
well crumble beneath your feet. The sound of water slamming thunderously

Close to the top of a large waterslide~
From here you can see the source of much of the disturbance in the caves.  Out
of a hole high in the north wall of the cavern, an entire river emerges.  It
begins its casacade down the slope in a fairly laminar fashion, but quickly
disperses into a mess of turbulent flow when it crashes over some rocks a mere
forty feet below you.  The water flies from those rocks and plummets down into
darkness. The catwalk vibrates here under the pounding wind, and enters a small
tunnel in the northern wall.

A rickety old loft~
A very small loft has been precariously built up here out of a few rotten
boards. There are several scratches in the boards and tree trunk here -
they are small and whatever made them has some pretty fierce claws. Some
vines have been cut and made into thin rope bridges which extend to the north
and east from here.

The cliff rises nearly straight up here, black and cold.  A crisp wind hits
the cliff just above the tops of the trees here and part of it shoots down
the rock face, chilling this area.

At a particularily interesting tree~
A large tree dominates this area.  It is older than the other trees in this
area, and has been affected by these odd environmental conditions more so than
the other trees.  Holding your light source close to its bark and carefully
inspecting leads you to the conclusion that the tree's trunk has been plated
with a stony substance.  Or perhaps the whole tree is petrified?!  You rub your
hands across your face to see if any stony substance has started to materialize
on it.  You sense that it won't settle on you by walking through here, but you
also deem that it would not be a good idea to take any long naps here.

It is no wonder at all that nothing seems to use this path, or even enter this

On a path cut into the ledge~
The shadow is not quite so thick here. The path on which you travel snakes
the base of the Butte. The path is cut into the cliff about six feet
above the forest floor. From here, you can proceed north along this path
down to the forest immediately to your west.

You stand directly beneath the back side of Horneg's Keep.  Apparently the
old mage uses this area as a dumping ground...living wastes as well as
rotting corpses, mutilated parts, bloodied armor, and freshly killed 
specimens lie splattered against the rocky base.  Rodents thrive here, taking
advantage of Horneg's daily donation of fresh blood.

A gentle clover groundcover covers the ground here.  Periwinkle bushes form
a border around the area, letting their violet fragrance into the air.  The sun
shines here constantly, and is accompanied by a gentle breeze.  Looking out
over the ocean, you can see the waves lapping up on huge rocks several hundred
yards from the shore.  A few white birch trees rise from the groundcover, and
engraved in the trunks are the marks from many young lovers.  There is only room
for two people to comfortably be here, giving this place such a sense of privacy
that you imagine gods couldn't even spy on you here.

floor of the cavern is covered with a choppy water.  Occasionaly, a larger
disturbance in the water than normal spashes water a good four feet in the air.
Spaced jumping distances apart in the water are a few large boulders.  It seems

Two large black iron pipes come from the stone far above you here to an odd

much force.  It rises straight up to the top of the cavern, where it enters a
small opening and disappears from sight.  To the east, you can squirm through
a hole and sqeeze into the driveshaft.  You can tell from the noise coming from
the shaft, however, that there are probably a lot of fast-moving pieces of hard
iron which could probably rip your tiny body to shreads and give it to the
tentacular arms.

On a small stone emerging from choppy waters~
There is hardly enough room for you to stand on this rock.  The choppy waters
lap at your feet, foreshadowing a wet trip to the south.  To the north, there
is a fairly large dry area at the base of the cavern.

On a stone just beneath the churning waters~
You struggle to keep your balance as the water pushes and pulls at your calves.
The rock is slippery, and you deem it important to move on quickly!  There is
a small stone to your north, and a bigger one to your east, but the larger one
rests in much more dangerous waters.

On a stone emerging from white waters~
The winds here make it nearly impossible to stand.  You crouch to protect
yourself from the beating water and wind.  You can see the base of the
waterslide straight to your north only by squinting your eyes to protect
them from the incredible winds.  Only a maniac would consider approaching the
waterslide any closer...  It would take a god's strength to keep from being
swept into the churning waters by the sharp wind and be beaten brutally to
death against the rocks.

DANGER! At foot of the waterslide~
The wind blasts you so hard you can't see a thing!  You loose your balance
and fall into the white waters!  You loose sense of which way is up, tumbling
heads over heals in the soft, bubble-filled water.  The soft tumbling quickly
changes to a brutal whacking as you get caught up in some rocks.  Your legs
start to feel numb and lifeless, and you cannot move.  The shock, coldness, and
lack of oxygen cause your death.

On a stone emerging from choppy waters~
The water here is extremely choppy and turbulent, and the stone upon which
you stand only keeps you inches above the tops of the crest.  Occasionally,
a larger wave than usual sweeps over the top of the stone, getting you wet
and nearly knocking you into the harsh waters.

The eastern ledge of the cavern~
You have arrived at a small ledge close to the waters on the eastern face of
the cavern.  The wind and noise are both terrible strong here, and the wind
suggests you head south along the cavern wall.

In the center of the cavern~
A relatively large stone island rises from the waters here.  The top of it
stands close to six feet above the turbulent waters, and is about as large
as a large dining table.  From here, you can see most of the cavern.  To the
north, a river falls from a high hole in the cavern wall, crashing down the
side over large rocks and pinnacles.  A small, apparently traversable ledge
sneaks along the cavern wall, passing directly behind the falling waters. The
waterslide terminates in a large pile of boulders, making a terrifically loud
pounding sound.  To the east, you can see the ledge continue to a small
hole in the cavern wall.  Below the entrance, and to the east a bit farther
lies a smaller exit.  Around you in the water lie a few scattered rocks.

A larger stone~
The top of this stone rises above the tops of the other stones by about a foot.
Through the whitecaps, you can see the top of a stone about six inches beneath
the surface of the water to your east.  To the north lies a safer path...  At
least the stone stands above the water's surface.

A stone beneath the surface of the water~
You stand knee-deep in the choppy water.  The rock on which you stand is
slippery and narrow.  You cannot find any exits from here except back from
where you came.

On a stone emerging from choppy waters~
You stand on a stone emergine no more than a few inches above the crests of
the choppy waters.  On occasion, a large disturbance throws a flood of water
over the stone, soaking your legs and nearly pushing you into the waters. You
can see another stone within jumping distance to the east.

On a trail south~
The trail here is well established by creatures of all types, but you can't
tell from the tracks what type of creatures they may be.  To the east and
west, the vegetation is quite thick, forbidding anyone to pass, but it seems
like to the south it may clear up a bit.

trail tracks~
By inspecting the tracks more closely, you realize that they have primarily been
made by human adventurers.  You are curious as to why all the tracks seem to
be headed south....
