Crystal bannisters line the stairwell as it goes up. There is a large portait
of the Amyrlin Seat at the top of the stairwell.

A clean dormer~
A glistening room where the Whitecloaks bed down for the night. A few cots
line the walls and the floor is spotless. Weapons and white cloaks hang on the
walls.

A gleaming hallway~
These barracks are the headquarters for the Whitecloaks in this region. The
Whitecloaks' sole goal in life is to remove Darkfriends from the realm. This
building is sparkling white just like the White tower.
