A large underground pool~
 Several trees stand here by a small, murkey pool of water. Their roots are
submurged in the pool, presumably depending on the water for nurishment.

Rules of Killer Game...
All you wanted to know about Killer game..
Rules are simple..
The killer game is done in the Killing Fields (old arena)
The zone is NEUTRAL now..
During a killer game, the area is locked..
(only a godly transfer can get you in)
You have to "register" to be included in the game.
(just tell ugadal enroll me..)
In this case you will be attributed One target ( a poor
medievian you will have to kill), and you will be the target
of someone..(but you don't know who......not yet !)
You have only to ATTACK  Y O U R  TARGET  , and defend yourself
from your "Hunter", when you are killed you are out of the game
Three is three different "Legal" kill
1st : You are killed by your hunter..(U are out of the game)
2nd : You are killed by your target..(U are out of the game)
3rd : You killed yourself ( Please do that if you want to
leave the game prematurely..or just tell ugadal..PLEASE DON'T
RECALL or GOHOME without having warned ugadal first)
Finally..I'm sure that some of you crazy PK addicts will want
to kill people who are not your targets...Well..The code will
check it..in this case the death guy will be fully restored
and transferred back in the killing fields..Still being in the
game. You may use this to "help" a "friend" in a bad situation.
The winner is the last living person in the fields..
Oh ! last thing..! THE GAME ONLY STARTS WHEN EVERYONE IS IN
THE ZONE..THE STARTING SIGNAL WILL BE GIVEN BY QUEST CHANNEL
DON'T KILL BEFORE THE SIGNAL !

sign~
Welcome to The Arena:
   The arena is a zone comprised of 60 rooms for your blood lust filled
pleasure. There is a map here, and nowhere else, giving you a layout of the
Arena, you may wish to make a paper copy of it, as it is easier than trying to
wander blindly around the arena. There are also rules of engagement posted on
the other sign here, which will explain how we think you should conduct
yourselves here. However, you are free to break those rules if you wish.

 This is a small intersection. Paths lead in all directions. You are struck by
the carnage here. There appears to have been a great battle here. Blood is
everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces of beaten armour and broken
blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here lead you to believe that the
dead and wounded were drug off in all directions.

On a small hill~
You are standing on a path that leads up through a stand of large trees.
Everything is green and it seems like eternal spring - this is Mother Nature
at her finest.  It is possible to descend into a tranquil valley from here.
