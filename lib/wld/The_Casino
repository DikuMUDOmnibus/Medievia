Yellow Brick Road~
Before you lies a road.. a yellow brick road that stretches for as far
as your eyes can see. On either side of the road are what seem to be portals
or doorways of some sort. These gateways to.. who knows where, go on forever
as well. You stare at each one as you pass, wondering what awaits you on
the other side. Your thoughts run wild, limited only by your imagination.

Mens Room~
The mens room is a smokey den of grumbling and odd body noises. The porter
is worked almost to death trying to keep the place neat. If it weren't for
the big winners who gave him big tips, he would probably run screaming from
this job! The stalls here are individual with running water closets and a
swinging door for privacy. The north wall is lined with sinks that have silver
plated and porcelain fittings. Each sink has a silvered glass mirror, but none
of the gentleman seems to want to look into theirs. You try and peer
through the cigar smoke to find an unoccupied stall.

Ladies Room~
The Ladies Room is a picture of elegance and taste. Individual stalls line the
south wall, each with its own door and running water-closet. There are soft,
cushioned chairs at vanity tables along the north wall. Each vanity has its
own silver tray with an assortment of expensive perfumes and a sink with silver
plated fixtures and running hot-and-cold water. There is also a mirror above
each vanity framed in exotic wood and fronted with genuine silvered glass.
A maid sits near the entrance, ready to clean any mess or help you with a towel
or any of your personal needs. What a WONDERFUL place to powder your nose!

Stairs~
 You stand on the grand stairs in the casino.  The huge oak staircase is highly
polished, and looks antique.  The stairs are covered with a thin, red carpet.
The shiny brass railing gently flows up the stairs.  The stairs are very busy
with customers going up and down.  There are workers standing around, keeping
the stairs looking new.

beige carpet, and the walls are painted off-white.  Many glass cabinets are
filled with wonderful, expensive trinkets to spend your winnings on, or to buy
a present for the now bankrupted wife.  The shopkeeper is wrapping a gift for
an impatient patron.  You turn around and head out of the crowded shop.

The walls are a deep plush red, lined with candles in dull brass
holders that seem to give off a never-ending glow. Smoke
rises from an old giant mahogany table which dominates the
room. Players lounge about betting amd laughing with casual
poker-faced ease. You feel the urge to join them in the
many games they are engaged in.

"Get Down, Make Love"
by Queen
version by Nine Inch Nails
"How old were you when you first let a man make love
to you?  Next who was he, next how did you feel at
the time, next how did you feel afterwards, what
did you feel, what did you think, were you pleased,
frightened, ecstatic, disgusted what did he say?
What words did you speak?  That's what I want to
know--now tell me now now all of it now tell me yes
yes!"
Get Down Make Love (4x)
You take my body
I give you heat
You say you hungry
I give you meat
I suck your life
you blow my head
make love
inside your bed
Everybody
Get Down Make Love (4x)
chorus:
Every time I get high
you wanna go down
every time I get high
you say you wanna go down
Tainted Love,
is sex too much
Every time I wanna
Get down, get down,
get down make love
I can squeeze
you can shake me
I can feel
when you break me
come on..[?]
...when you take me
You make love (4x)
You can't make everybody
get down make love
get down make love
chorus (2x)

not free from clatter. An old man stoops bent over a slot machine,

catches your eye, dragging it away for a moment from
the glinting of levers being tugged. Seems to be an obese
woman with a smirk on her face, garbed in rich attire and
mauve plumes.
How many people has that face seen go to ruin within
these walls? Not you! Surely!

slams her hand on the wall, setting the picture upright again.

Casino Roof~
You are standing on the roof of the casino.  This is where people come to
scream out their frustrations, and to be alone.  The roof is covered with
small rocks, neatly raked into place.  The roof is fairly large, and you
hope you do not fall off as you stand and gaze out into Medievia's
wonderous lands.

Yellow Brick Road~
Before you lies a road.. a yellow brick road that stretches for as far
as your eyes can see. On either side of the road are what seem to be portals
or doorways of some sort. These gateways to.. who knows where, go on forever
as well. You stare at each one as you pass, wondering what awaits you on
the other side. Your thoughts run wild, limited only by your imagination.
