Outside the City of Thalos~
You stand on a narrow ledge atop a plateau. Vast desert stretches out
to the horizon as far as you can see. A crumbling stone wall is built along
the edge of the plateau, running north-south. At waist height there is a
hole, leading through the wall to the other side. A debris-cluttered
path leads down the plateau to the sandy floor.

The base of a plateau~
You stand at the base of a plateau rising up to the east. Surrounding you
to the north, west and south lies nothing but the barren dunes of a desert.
A rocky trail winds its way up the side of the plateau and the mouth of a
cave lies to the east, leading under it.

Mouth of an ancient cave~
You are at the entrance of a large, rocky cavern leading under the plateau.
The surrounding rockface has been worn smooth by time and the elements.  To
the east is darnkess and to the west you can see vast grasslands.  Strange
runes, unknown to you, have been carved into the cavern walls.

Travel through this part of the cave is slow going.  The ceiling is low
and the floor uneven.  A gaping hole leads down into a larger clearing and
a faint hint of light is detected from the west.

The base of a plateau~
The bleached white sand is fairly shallow here, covering a base of rock.
To the west, a plateau rises up from the desert floor.  A narrow trail
makes it's was up from here, but it is much too rocky for your wagon to
make it up.  Peering out across the desert, you can see nothing else on
the horizon.

The Grand Gate of Thalos~
You stand in the shadow of a gigantic stone archway.  The two
steel gates have been forced open and have rusted in place. A hollow
gust of wind blows by you into the deserted, and seemingly destroyed,
city. A rocky trail leads down the side of the plateau.
An old wooden sign stands before you, the writing is barely visable.

side is a collapsed house while on the other is the entrance to a large
ruined building, which looks to have been of some importance.  A sign
hangs above the open doorway with the words CITY HALL writen upon it.
Eerie sounds echo from the large structure.  Near the center of town
you see a large domed building, relatively intact.

Flowers and trees have been smashed into the ground and lawn benches
thrown through walls. A large marble fountain in the center of the
courtyard still stands, though, defying any attempts to destroy its
beauty. Above stands the remains of one of the watchtowers. Archways

A collapsed home~
    All that's left of this house is a few scattered piles of rubble
and a very large blast crater. Obviously someone or something important
was once housed here. A shrieking howl chills your blood.

A tall dwelling~
This seems to be the tallest structure remaining in the city. At
one time this might have been a mighty fortress, and it appears
to be the most intact building in the old city.  The walls are round
and made of stone.  On the back wall you see a large boulder which may
have once blocked a small hole in the wall, just large enough
for you to fit through on your hands and knees.
On the right side of the room you see and old wooden staircase leading
up to the second floor.

A tiny hidden room~
This tiny room must have been a hiding place for those who lived here
years ago.  There are no windows and the only light is coming from a
torch which is burning on the far wall.  Could it be that this place
is not so deserted as you though?  Shivers run up your spine as you
realize that in front of you sits a large stone sarcophacus with the
image of a man carved into the lid.  Maybe you shouldn't stick around
in here for too long.

sarcophacus~
You see a large stone box.  There is an image of a man with long
flowing hair.  The sarcophacus seems to be closed tight.  You wonder
if anything, or anyone, is inside.

    You stand under a tall watchtower. Narrow back alleys lead west and
south and a very weak looking ladder leads up into the tower.

A bath house~
    This was once the bath house for the commoners of the city. Hot
steamy water still wells up from a hole in the floor. Obviously there
is a hot spring located under the city (making the decision to put
a city here seem much more reasonable). Closer inspection of the water
yields a dead body floating around in it, skin melted away from months
of floating in there. The west wall has collapsed revealing another
collapsed house.

An upright house~
    This home is practically the only one around that is still standing.
Except for the massive hole in the east wall, everything else looks
intact, including the windows. Great amounts of steam issue forth from
the hole in the east wall.

On the second floor~
The minute you step off onto this floor you realize it was a mistake.
The old rotter floorboards threaten to give way under your feet, impaling
yourself on jagged boards below.

The Temple of Thalos~
You stand within one of the most holy places in the realm. This
stunning domed temple once housed the city's worshipers en masse.
Unfortunately, it succumbed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desecrated. Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending light streaming in on
you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tongue.
     Wind gusts through the four archways and howls and screams can be
heard from all parts of the city.
A large statue of marble stands at the middle of the altar.

statue figure~
You gaze upon an ancient statue of a man with long flowing hair and

untouched by the destruction around you.  Its seems that this must
have been the image that the worshipers prayed to.  It looks as if
someone has been taking great care to preserve the figure.
