 You have swam into a murky area of the sea. Seaweed is floating around
aimlessly and other substances seem to be holding steady in the currents. You
find it difficult to swim as your limbs constantly tangle in the seaweed.

Sandy Path~
You are walking along a sandy path. The sound of waves crashing upon the
shore, and the breeze in the clean air, all cause your heart to race as you
realize how exciting the water can be. You look around at the beautiful clear
blue skies and take in the view as a gull soars overhead, lands close to
the waterline, and hops about in the wet sand. As you glance down at the
path you're walking along, you see some broken shells here and there
sticking out, but they really don't bother you at all -- everything is
peaceful, and it's simply beautiful out.

Hot Path~
Ouch! You suddenly find that the sand in the path has gotten really hot!
Down towards the shoreline, you can see huge waves rolling in and washing
on to the beach in a rhythmic motion. It all seems very hypnotizing, and
the view is so beautiful, but damn this sand's hot!

You are standing in the center of a very small, sandy island. Right next to

Outer Ocean~
You swim through and are confronted with a vast blue expanse spreading out
before your eyes. It is simply huge, and seems to get darker the farther out it
goes. The odd thing is that you can barely make out any sign of structures or
forms in the water -- it's all empty. You look down to see you're standing on a
ledge, while before you is an entrance to a cage about three feet away from the
ledge. It looks like there'a a whole series of cages forming a tunnel leading
out from here. You notice small pieces of seaweed floating along with the
current, and larger plants to the east.

obviously protect you from anything outside, but you have to wonder about
what might lie ahead. The cages continue on to the south, and to the north
is the entrance.

disfigured, and a few bars are actually broken and jutting up. The water
seems to be a little more muddy at this point -- hopefully it's just dirt.

You are carefully diving down between two very large slabs of rock. Above you

As you make your way down, you set a few rocks loose that drift to the sea
floor, or wherever this leads. Better be careful here...

your arms and legs. After a few minutes of disturbing the plants and mud, you
create your own swamp. You feel lost. Hopefully you can remember the way out.

 You have swam into a murky area of the sea. Seaweed is floating around
aimlessly and other substances seem to be holding steady in the currents. You
find it difficult to swim as your limbs constantly tangle in the seaweed. You
try to clear a path for yourself, but it's impossible, the water is like slime
here.

Further Into The Cavern~
You clamber through the darkness and find yourself in another section
of the cavern. There are just as many passages leading in and out of this
one, and alas, you are confused as to which one you came through. The same
dark water fills the cavern, and you have the same eery sense that one
wrong move could be your last.

A Vast And Empty Cavern~
You step through the glowing warmth of the stone and find yourself in a
very cold and dark cavern. The atmosphere has completely changed -- something
just doesn't seem right. You peer into the darkness around you and see many
passages leading off in all directions, and when you look back, you realize
you've forgotten which one you came in through. The water in here seems
heavy and dark, and you get a strong impression that death is all around.

Deeper Into The Cavern~
This large cavern looks just like the others you've gone through so far,
and has just as many passages leading in and out of it. You peer into the
dark through the murky water, and wonder how much longer this leads on. The
same aura of death and decay can be felt all around you.

Utter Darkness~
As you enter the passage, a rough current starts to carry you down into
total darkness. A loud rumbling can be heard as rocks begin to loosen
and fall, pelting your body from all directions. In vain you try to grab
hold of something, but the current is too strong and batters you on all
sides. By the time your body settles, it's merely a bloated and bruised sack
of borken bones and organs... YOU ARE DEAD!

1277~
 You are surrounded by large plants, as if in a jungle of seaweed, in all
directions. As these huge plants sway back and forth, you keep your distance,
trying not to get tangled. A beam of light reflects on you from above, and a
solid blue glow is to the west. You realalize that this is the perfect place
for predator and prey, as the plants act as a place to hide. As the plants move
you think you see something in the distance, or is it your imagination?

Outer Ocean~
You are on the outside of that large fishing net now. Hopefully the dangers of
the deep do not consume you as is has done to other prey. As you look up, you
notice the sweeping action of the ocean that can force you into the large steel
net. Along the floor there are several hundred recently sprouted plants, and to
the east, the plants grow larger. As you look west, you notice a tunnel like
structure. The south is blocked by an errant steel grate, it may end somewhere
in the east.

Old Rotted Tree~
You are standing in the shadow of an old tree whose trunk has been bleached
white from the salty air and weather. It casts a long shadow on the sand
before you, leaving the area nice and cool -- a perfect resting spot
for hot and tired people. Up in its branches you see what looks like
some boards nailed together, all the way up in the top.

Boiling Water~
Glowing lava is rushing up from the ground below you. The intense heat
makes you feel as if you're boiling. As you stare at the glow of the lava, you
begin to fall in a daze and drift toward it. Suddently a sharp current knocks
you into a wall, and you wake up before touching the deadly river. There is
an exit to the west, and a fast current is rushing in to the room from the
south. As you look down into the lava, you can see many corpses burning
and melting into nothing.

You are swimming underneath a large buoy. The water is very clear and vision

deeper from the buoy and father from the shore there will be plenty. You cant
swim horizontal in any direction due to an angled current that would drag you
into the unknown. Deeper down you can notice the floor of the sea.

As you swim up from the sea you suddenly get caught in a huge wave. After a

Deep Waters~
You're swimming on the sea's magnificent floor. Different life forms bring
out the curiosity in you, and huge rocks block your way to the north and south.
You can swim east to the open ocean, or head west into what appears to be
some sort of cave.

Cave~
It is cloudy and hard to navigate in this dark, murky water. As you feel
your way around, something is startled by your touch and makes the water
murkier as it flees in terror. You can't feel anything in any direction, but
you do notice that you are sinking slowly in the soft mud that rests below
you. Suddenly, hundreds of fish swim around you in a circle, spinning you
round and round until a small tornado-like sensation moves you in a magical
way. You are confused and dizzy, but within moments, the water clears and
settles. The area is completely different. You find yourself standing in
a small cave. The water is as crystal clear as the crystals that can be
found about the cave walls. The only exit is to the south.

Strange Tunnel~
As you are swimming on the ocean floor in this tunnel like structure,
you notice that there are many crystals embedded in the walls. The
magical aurora that surrounds this area makes your heart pump extra hard as
you wonder what else is going to happen. The floor is very solid and quite
strange. From the corner of your eye you notice a strange marking in the wall.

      Welcome to the great UNDERWATER maze.
Please enter with caution, there is danger lurking behind every room and with
any luck you will find the one exit which leads out. It was created to fool
the mightiest adventurer but in the past has even trapped deities for hours
of confusion. Certainly everything looks the same but there are an infinite
ways to get lost. Mappers are welcome but will only get confused. Good Luck!

notice that the floor is made of thick clear crystal and seems to float above
the soft mud of the Deep Sea. As you glance up, you realize that the sea is
composed of hundreds of beautifull life forms. Other than the sea floor there
are no other structures that can help you determine location.

and thrive on the energy radiating from the glowing stone.

Suddenly you step forth into a bright glow as the darkness fades behind you.
A feeling of warmth fills your body, and you notice that instead of a cold
dark floor, you're standing on light sand. There is a great deal of energy
emanating from the room, and scattered all about the floor are heaps and mounds
of treasure. It all seems free to be taken, that is, unless something decides
to stop you from doing so...

you can see what looks like a coral reef reflecting in the sunlight.

Reef Entrance~
As you swim into the entrance of the reef, many different species of
sea plants meet your eyes. Anemones, Coral, and Sponges cover the entire
area around you. The garden gets larger to the north, and to the south is a
rotting house. The water seems to flow in a rhythmic motion around you.

tiny life forms that live here. A plant with a minty green color floats
above you as you study the coral on the bottom of the ocean floor.

This is a colder, darker place in the reef. The plants and other life forms
are much larger and bend towards the west. A few bubbles seem to be coming
from the south wall, where there is no exit.

You are swimming in a beautiful garden overflowing with many varieties
of plants. There is no coral here though, as it seems to have been removed.

Ridge~
You're swimming along a large ridge which seems to have been created by
someone or something to prevent those nasty storms from the east from
washing away the plant life in the reef. The reef entrance is to the north,
and the ridge continues along to the south.

Tredding in warm water, you find yourself in a very warm cove. Tales from

You are in clear, warm waters, where the plants reach towards the sun. The
overgrowth of the plants serves as a great feeding ground for many sea
creatures. Waves crash high up against the rocks blocking the way to the
north, and in the distance to the south the water seems darker. You can
swim up into the waves, but be careful near the rocks.

the west, blocking your way.

Before a Huge Cave~
As you swim along the huge ridge, you come accross a huge hole in it. The
cavelike hole seems to be one large feeder for many of the smaller organisms
of the sea. This seems to be a very peacefull place besides the huge gashes
that surround its entrance. There is open water to the west, east, and south.
Rocks prevent you from surfacing and diving here.

Cave Entrance~
As you swim in to the cave, the dark mud-like sediment covering the floor
is wafted into the air. It's nearly five inches deep -- hopefully you're not
disturbing any creature's home. The walls are dark and encrusted with some
black deposit. Any further progress into the cave is blocked by a huge
iron grating, with bands nearly six inches thick. It's covered in barnacles and
looks like it hasn't moved in ages. The whole area is dark and gloomy, and
you shiver as the water itself seems even more cold than the rest of the sea.

the grating very close to the floor.

panel~
The panel is somehow connected to the grating, and has a large recess in
its face in the shape of an eight-spoked wheel. It looks like it's some
sort of magical lock mechanism.

Passage~
You are in a small passageway that leads south to the cave entrance and
north to a darker area. The walls are slimy to the touch and covered in a
black inky substance. The murky water does not seem so pleasing as something
tickles your feet.

The water is very discolored by some foreign substance. It's too dark to
see anything, but you manage to feel that the walls are very slippery
and the mud around you is thick. The passage seems to continue north

Guardians Liar~
You have swam into a huge cavern which has a red aura glowing from its walls.
Bloody guts and flesh drift and swirl around, as if a great battle had
taken place. In the north wall is a small hall, just large enough for you
to fit through. As you carefully walk around, you notice that the floor
seems to be composed mostly of fecal material scattered with a few body
parts.

You are in a den which seems to be the home of a large octopus. There are

something enscribed on the wall here in the shape of a sign once made in
Medievia.

Dead Mans Hole~
As you walk into this room of the cave, there is a loud rumble and before
you can react, you're crushed by a barrage of spikes falling from the
ceiling of the cavern. As you lay on the ground next to the countless
other corpses that suffered the same fate, you wish you had only gave a bit
more thought to your decision... YOU'RE DEAD! (It wasn't the greatest life
anyway though, you have to admit)

to swim deeper here. A few chunks of flesh float around, and to the east
you notice that the water is very bloody. To the south the water is an
elegant blue color. Swimming in any direction is possible.

Deep Waters~
You are on the bottom of the Deep Sea. The sea floor is composed mostly
of sand, rocks, coral, and few plants. Fish seem to swim without any fear as
you swim around. There is a very small current which is moving small sediment
to the north. To the west the water seems to darken, but deep blue water
surround you in every other direction. Swimming in every direction is probable.

You are swimming on the botton of the Deep Sea. The water is of a deep blue
color and it is very cold. The sand on the sea floor seems very loose as it
probably hides many aquatic life forms. Plants reach upwards soaking up the
light as small fish swim around nibbling on them for their nutrition. The seas
current is very weak as it comes from the south. Swimming in the deep blue sea
at its sandy bottom, you notice many varieties of fish and plants as you
scan the area. As you look around, a large ridge aligns the northern area and a
large net like structure is in the distant south.

Fishing Net~
This area of the sea seems to be calm, but looks can be deceiving. A huge
fishing net blocks the gateway to the south. Beyond the net must be hundreds
and hundreds of new things to explore and conquer. But it is a mystery to
many as to why this large, steel net is stretched out here.

Lost underwater~
You are being thrown around by the powerful current of the ocean. You
hit your head on something, and your vision becomes blurred. You have no
idea which way you're swimming.

A Narrow Passage~
You slip through the crack and enter a very narrow passage that keeps on
twisting and winding around. As you follow along, you get somewhat disoriented
and lose your sense of direction. You finally come to what seems to be an
end, and above you is some light -- at least, more light than what's down
here.

An Underwater Avalanche~
As you climb down through the crevice, you suddenly hear a loud rumbling as
an even darker shadow covers the area! The stone walls on either side of
the crevice are collapsing! You scatter as the boulders come crashing down,
weighing a ton even in water. As you scramble about, you spy a ledge to
the east and huddle in its shelter. Luckily, you escape with only a few
cuts and bruises, but alas, the passageway back up is blocked.

Deep Waters~
You are at the bottom of a huge ledge which leads up to warmer waters. The
ledge blocks your way to the west and north. The creatures of the sea
frantically swim away in fear as a rock falls from the top of the ledge. Exits
lead to the south, east, and up.

You are at the bottom of a huge ledge which leads up towards the shallow
waters of the great Deep Sea. Hundreds of small fish scatter as if something
had frightened them. The water is a dark blue color, and is extremely cold. The
ledge blocks the way to the north and east, but exits lead to the west and
south.

A Ship Wreck~
As you clamber over the rocks and swim up onto the rotting deck, you
wonder what kind of crew once piloted this vessel. Many planks are cracked
and broken at jarring angles, and the ship seems to be split in the middle.
Fish swim in and out of holes and live in the plants that now grow here.
You see some letters enscribed in corroded bronze on a broken mast.
The remains of the ship stretch out to the east.

mast broken~
There's only a stump of a mast sticking out from the broken deck of the ship.
Its jagged edge is about 5 feet off the deck, and off to the north you can
see what appears to be the top half of the mast lying at an angle, covered
with barnacles.

Every few feet a plank sticks up at a jarring angle from the deck. As you

A Ship Wreck~
As you continue along the broken deck, you notice even more signs of life
in a place you thought would show only death. It seems there's a whole
ecosystem set within the wreck. At this end of the deck, there is a large
hole leading down to the hold of the ship. A rotting sail is flayed over
one side of the wreck, slowly disintegrating into the surrounding waters.

You swim down through the gaping hole into utter darkness. As you cast your

strewn about the floor amidst the debris, and splintered beams are
criss-crossed about the wreck. You also notice what looks like an old

A Strange Cavern~
The tracks lead in to an even wider cavern, the walls of which are
plastered with blood and pieces of flesh. The cavern floor is all
dug up and disturbed as if there was a great struggle. In the center
of the room is a large stone-like slab that is littered with carcasses
and remains from a variety of sea animals. As the currents in the murky
water here waft debris before your eyes, you notice that the clicking
sound is even louder here and you can hear something sloshing and
echoing through the cavern. The trail leads west...

The Lair Of Captain Crab-Leg!~
Upon entering the room, the sight of the gore literally makes your stomach
heave. The sludge is piled up high here, and you can tell that it's
composed mostly of fecal matter and waste. The smell, even underwater, is
overpowering and you feel queasy as the gut-filled water swirls around
you. In the midst of a large nest of bone and plant matter is a huge
crab-like creature busily picking at something's remains. Obviously,
this is its home, and you've obviously disturbed it's snack...

Decaying Basement~
You swim down between the floorboards into a numbing darkness. As you cast

that drift lazily in the currents here. Rotting junk is piled around, and
you can see an old trunk against the west wall. Toppled over in the corner
underneath some shelves is what looks like a globe, and a rotting blanket

You look up and down the shelves, knocking stuff on to the floor as you
sift through the junk. It's too confusing to even sort through it all.
There are cups filled with sea-crud, some cracked porcelain, and other
odds and ends that you don't recognize in the corrosion all over
the place.
~
E
globe~
The globe is covered with debris, but you brush most of it away and
see a map of the world. You can see the continent of Medievia in the
eastern hemisphere, and in the western hemisphere is the continent of
Trellor, seperated by a large ocean. Off the west coast of Trellor is
the Deep Sea, where you are now, right next to Lake Contnea on the
mainland.

trunk chest~
The trunk is rotting away, and as you lift it's lid it simply breaks off
the hinges. Inside you see a bunch of old clothes, mostly rags now, and
some other junk. Nothing special really, just some tools and what looks
like a broken picture frame.
~
E
tools tool~
There are many tools lying within the trunk here, including a hammer,
a small shovel, a crowbar, and others. All of them are corroded very
badly.
~
E
picture frame broken~
The picture frame is broken, and the glass is all cracked except for a single
shard that remains. A torn picture still is stuck in the frame, and when you
brush away the sediment, you can make out a smiling deadhead wearing a pair
of birkenstocks on his feet. Achad is scrawled beneath the picture of this
ancient god.
~
E
desk~
The wood of the desk is decaying slowly, and feels soft and mushy to the
touch in some parts. It is encrusted with sediment from the waters,
and a few drawers are still barely attached to it.

When you open the middle drawer, a tiny fish slips out and swims away
to the upstairs. Other than that, the drawers are empty.

Wow! A Club House! You always loved having one when you were younger, and
climbing into here brings back many fond memories. There are windows on each
wall here, and you can look out to the south to see a vast sea before your
eyes. To the north of the beach is a huge lake, and there are some mountains
to the east. There are some crates piled around the room that you can sit on,
and though there's some trash, the place seems to be in decent shape.

Path to the Sea~
You are on a small, sandy path that leads further south to the sea. Just
a little ahead of you is a large old tree, blocking the sun and casting a long
shadow on the path before you. As you continue along the cool, damp path, you
get closer to the tree and notice that there appear to be some words
carved into the trunk. There's a salty taste in the air, and only the
occasional cry of a bird interrupts the soft and gentle sound of waves
from the south.
