The Great Stone Tunnel Bridge - Southside.~
Entrance to a beautiful stone carved tunnel.  It is the
bridge over troubled waters as you have been told, but noone has seen the
water that lies beneath for many years.
There are delicately carved angels and floral designs all over the
walls and ceiling of the tunnel.  The bridge is lit by the flames
coming from the statues to either side of the passage.
They are placed throughout, allowing plenty of light.

statue angel flame~
You see a pale blue marble statue.  It holds a torch in its right
hand, and the other, outstretched, palm up seemingly welcoming you
through the tunnel.  You try to put the torch out, it neither burns
you nor dies in its brilliance.

The Great Stone Tunnel Bridge.~
This portion of the tunnel is very diverse.  Rumors told that
the engravings tell the story of the enchanted lands to the north.
To see the engravings just look westwall, ceiling and eastwall.

eastwall~
The east wall is the figure of obscure fear and confusion.  You look
at the engravings and only recognize what looks to be a possessed
rabbit. You get this idea from the fact it appears to be attacking
an angelic figure in the carvings.  All around this
wall seems to be a haze...a merky feeling comes to you.
East seems to be a bad direction in which to follow....
~
E
ceiling top~
The heavens of the westwall seem to shadow into the ceiling
only to be met by disarray from the eastwall.  In the midst of
the two joining each other are intertwined branches.
They appear to be very calming, but why??  Nothing really special about
their detail or anything.  Just a calming feeling comes to you
as you look at the figures.
~
E
westwall~
You see figures of beauty such that you have never seen in real life.
They combine heavens and earth showing no real seperation, you know
you will never be able to describe with mere words what you have seen.
Maybe this is a unicorn by the cloud carvings..but what are
those lil figures by the trees..  Just Beautiful...

The Great Stone Tunnel Bridge - Northside.~
Entrance to a beautiful carved stone tunnel bridge.  The engravings
on either side of you are of animals and flowers.  You
have heard that all the carvings in this tunnel were from the
tiny wings of fairys.  But you are not sure of this fact, although they are
devinely carved and detailed.  All through the tunnel as far as
you can see are these statues holding torches to light your way.

The wall of stone to the south is as high as the tunnel entrance to the
east. You can hear the rushing river behind it.  The cobblestone road
leads to the east and west.

jasmine~
As many people already know of Jasmine, let me fill in the minds of
those who dont. Jasmine was the child of Queen fillin and King
Phillip. The Queen was put to sleep by pricking her finger on a
spinning wheel many years ago. No spinning wheels are alowed anywhere
in the enchanted forest since. Phillip kissed her and she awoke.
They had Jasmine two years after their marriage. As Jasmine grew up
she always played on the mountain to the northwest corner of the
Enchanted Forest. Phillip, realizing her love for the mountain and
the pixies that lived near, named the mountain for his daughter and
built her a large castle playhouse. The mother Pixie at that time
was a beautiful pixie named Fantazia. Fantazia loved the forest and
gardens. To keep the forest and gardens beautiful for his daughter
em lays her head back on to your shoulder... this is nice. made a deal with Fantazia. He built the town Fantazia for the
pixies in return for their keeping the mountain and the surrounding
forest beautiful. After Jasmine moved into her playhouse fairys and
pixies became her closest friends. The witch, before her death had
a daughter also. The dark princess Razell. Razell heard of Jasmine'
playcastle and built one for herself on the dark mountain in
the northeast corner of the forest. They began to torment the pixies
and Jasmine so Phillip ordered the great wall to be built around the
entire forest and River, as foul creatures where using the river to get
to the west side. Razell is not spoke of in Fantazia.... Phillip
engaged his best fighter to be Jasmine' protector. Sir Franklin stays
with Jasmine in her castle playhouse. It is guarded also by Jasmine' own
private Panda guardsmen. Dont take this lightly, as they are fully armed.
Panda' have always been Jasmine' Favorite animal and minature roses
her favorite flower.
~
E
fantazia~
The little town of Fantazia was founded by the pixie Fantazia
Sague. Thus the name of the town and the river that borders the
enchanted forest. The pixies that work in the forest and the surrounding
area live here. We have a population of 42 residents. Only the Great
Pixie lives off in the forest somewhere. She is a direct ancestor of
Fantazia. When the queen and king built Jasmines playhouse castle
on Jasmine mountain they asked Fantazia and her family to oversee the
beautiful forest below. We have done that ever since and look forward
to taking care of it for many days to come.

attached to the wall that is full of velcro overalls.  There is a bottle
stuck on this wall and some blocks too.  I bet lil Pixie tots hang
around all day.

City Hall - Fantazia~
You walk up the step and enter the double doors of City Hall.
The hallways are carpeted in a deep red carpet.  The black fringe
around the carpet brings out the crest that is woven in as a design.
When you first looked you thought that there were soldiers lining
the wall, but after a second look, they are just statues with full
armor. Too bad that the armor cannot be removed.  It would
buff the worst of warriors.  There are swords and crests hanging
high on the walls.  The hallway continues to the east.  The
Shiriff's office is through the double doors north.
