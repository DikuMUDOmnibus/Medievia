The Stream~
You are standing in a small stream. The cool water feels good running over

being here.  The current has become more powerful here and you can see rapids
to the south.  You conclude that it wouldn't be safe to continue any farther.

You are on a new grass path. The path is freshly cut but looks like
it was here before. There is a calm breeze swaying the tall grass.
Far off to the south you see a huge cave. The grass path leads south
of here.
