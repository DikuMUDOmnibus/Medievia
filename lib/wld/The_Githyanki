sort. You also see what looks like kneeling mats placed around the statue so
as to kneel and pray. It appears that this building is not quite deserted and
you feel a shiver of fear run the length of your spine. There is an archway
leading north and you can exit the temple to the south.

and in the center of the room you see a large black book resting on a pedestal.
Shelves line the east and west walls. On these are several scrolls and other
objects of little interest. A mural covers most of the northern wall. The
feeling of evil seems to consume you. You wonder if you should stay here for
much longer.

feet above you. The walls of the castle are constructed of large slabs of a
green stone that give off a bright glow illuminating the entire cavern. To the
north is a huge gate made of fine silver blocking the arched entrance to the
castle. You look upon it in awe and wonder who could have constructed such a
large underground building. There is also a path that leads east-west in front

Tip Top Of The Tower.~
You stand in the top of the tower. You see where there foul odor is coming
from. Dead bodies are strewn all around you and it makes you feel a little
uneasy. Blood covers the floor here and is splattered on the walls as well.
In the center of the room is a large block of wood with a basket resting in
front of it. The smell makes you want to puke, but you think you should
leave before taking the time to do so.

At The Base Of Tower II.~
You find yourself standing at the bottom of a tall tower. There are torches
mounted on the walls here and you have no trouble seeing. Someone has erected
a ladder here as the staircase is all broken and decayed, surely unclimbable.
You smell a strange odor wafting down from above.
