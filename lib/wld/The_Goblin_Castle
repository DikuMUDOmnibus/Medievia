The path to the Castle Entrance.~
You stand on a short path leading to the castle entrance, just ahead of you
lies the drawbridge, which is open, and under the drawbridge, a thick black
moat full of sludge, which stinks so badly it stings your nostrils.

On the Drawbridge~
You stand on the drawbridge at the gates of the castle. The gates are closed,
the stench of the sludge in the moat really makes you queasy. There is a
signpost here. Normally the GATES are closed.
Items: Signpost.

signpost~
A warning, or if you prefer, a greeting...
   Welcome to the Goblin Castle, if you have come to see the Goblin King,
please be sure you've brought enough of an offering to please him, as he's in
a particularly sour mood today.

The entryway of the Goblin Castle~
You're in the entryway of the Goblin Castle, a huge mechanism stands here, a
sophisticated system of pullies, ropes and chains, to work the drawbridge. A
strong looking goblin is asleep next to it. On the walls of the entryway there
are some odd looking tapestries depicting battles, and magical scenes as well.
A spear, shield and sword hang on another wall, it appears just for decoration.
The GATES back out of the castle are to the east.

This is apparently the main hallway, leading through the center of the Goblin
Castle, ahead of you you can see doorways leading to the north and south, and
in the distance you can see that the hallway makes a turn to the north. Also
you can turn to the south from this position and head down another side
hallway.

A Goblin Dining Room~
You stand in a Goblin Dining Room, a large table runs the length of this room,
with dozens of chairs surrounding it. Placesettings are on the table, but
there doesn't appear to be any food here, obviously it's not meal time for
these particular Goblins. Or maybe they're just waiting for the main course to
show up in their dining room?
