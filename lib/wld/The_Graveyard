The Gate to Medievia~
You stand outside the Gates of the City of Medievia. The great gates are made
of iron and wood, and are extremely thick. They are at least 30 feet high, and
the wall around Medievia to the north and south here is about 25 feet high.
There are no guard posts at the gates, as this is a commonly traveled road.
An old and worn down cobble stone road leads east away from town.

The Caretaker's kitchen is small but well furnished. There are bright copper
pots hanging above a cutting-board counter in the center of the room. There is a solid cast iron pot-bellied stove in the far corner, and a good supply of
kindling next to it. The glass-fronted larders seem to be full, and there is a
large tun of wine against the west wall. The Caretaker may not be rich, but he
leads a comfortable life!

There seems to be more than meets the eye where the caretaker is concerned!
Walking the few steps down to this room, you see it contains crates filled
with crushed ice packed in sawdust. In the ice are various human body parts
and organs. It seems the caretaker dabbles in a little contraband body part
trading. Perhaps he would sell you a choice specimen if you ask him nicely?

The Grand Pipe Organ - North Gallery~
This is the pipe organ used during all of the Cathedral's services. It is
probably the grandest musical instrument you have ever seen!
The pipes soar in polished silver majesty to frame the giant rose window
overhead, the largest the size of a tree in diameter down to the smallest
which is no bigger than your pinky. The organ itself has keys of traditional
ebony and ivory, but the knobs used to adjust the pitch-valves for the pipes
are each crowned with a glittering jewel! the organ frame is made of the
finest imported wavy-grained rosewood. The organist at this Cathedral is
envied throughout Medievia for her honor of being able to play such a
wondrous creation.

There are two basalt sarcophagi in this room. Both are intricately carved
and have bas reliefs of their occupants on the lids. One seems to have
been recently plundered by graverobbers, but the second is intact -- and
immoveable. There are rusted and broken torch holders along both walls,
but the torches have long since burned or rotted away.

The Mausoleum East Room~
Two large marble slabs sits in the middle of the room, with the names of the
occupants carved in the tops. They are very old, and you can no longer make
out the inscriptions. 4 torches line the walls, but they are very old as well,
and have long since burned out. The room is made up of various types of marble
and granite, it looks as if this is the final resting place of two very
important people.

are plain but comfortable, and there is a simple silver tea set for the
serving of the priests favorite warm brew.
    Not much else is here, except a kitchen to the west and a narrow flight

The Necromancers' Sanctum Mortis~
   This is the Sanctum Mortis of the Sorcerers of Undeath. Rancid fumes
fill the air from unholy incenses, obscuring drawn and carved sigils and
circles of power on the floor, ceiling and walls. Strange decanters of
unhealthy-looking stuff and scrolls of all sorts cover the work tables and
shelves. Along the east wall is a rack of hundreds of small, glowing blue
bottles. Tiny, agonized apparitional faces peer at you you through the
crystal walls of those bottles, lips moving silently. They seem to be
asking -- pleading for your help to free them. Do you dare?

Knight-Captain's Quarters~
These are the personal quarters of the Knight-Captain of the Order of St.
George. This righteous warrior commands the knights that protect the Church
and the neighboring countryside. His military bearing and austere nature are
reflected in the sparse, utilitarian furnishings found within this room. A
bed no wider than a field cot and hardly more comfortable is in the far corner.
A desk which can be folded and transported easily serves the Captain for the
paperwork he must complete. There is also a campaign chair and a sturdy chest
at the side of the desk. The only other furniture is the armor stand in the
near corner that normally holds his suit of immaculate half-plate mail.

There is a small wooden bench for one here and an ornately perforated
screen separates the priest from you.
    You have the feeling that no matter what you have or haven't done,
the priest will have you doing a minimum of ten 'Hail, Mary's!

counter runs the length of the west wall, where there is a window overlooking
the priest's vegetable and herb garden. Cabinets to each side of the window
and along the north wall are well stocked with spices and preserved food. A
set of copper cookpots hangs from hooks above the board, and sturdy stoneware
dishes fill one of the cabinets as well. It's quite a homey place, actually.
    There is a door to the south.

All types of vegetables are planted here! Squashes, melons celery and lettuce
are visible. The leafy tops of carrots, beets, potatoes and turnips poke
through the soil, and cauliflower and broccoli are scattered throughout the
plantings. The priest has SOME mercy, however. He has refused to plant any
brussel sprouts, even after much chastising from the nuns. His final remark
was "No child of God should suffer so much as to force those smelly sprouts
upon them!" The nuns have since let the matter lie.

From this landing the East Gallery extends to the north all the way to the
cross aisles in front of the altar. It is indeed brightly lit from the
windows in the wall.

The East Gallery~
Tall stained glass windows illumine the gallery from here to the rose window.
Deep rich colors in the glass catch the rays of the rising sun and seem to
warm the place simply with light. Three rows of pews line the gallery to your
right and run its entire length.

The West Gallery~
As you near the center of the Gallery, you notice the spectacular work-
manship of the stained glass windows. They seem to actually catch the light
and hold it once it hits the glass. Perhaps it is some trick of the eye, or
perhaps a divine intervention of some sort. It does make you feel safer to be
in the church, however.

The West Gallery and South End of the Rose Window~
This is the beginning of the large, west rose window. It towers above you in
a pale glow of wondrous craftsmanship. Pale hues of blue, gold, green and rose
tint the floor and spill over into the church itself. There is a commanding
view of the church below from here. It is definitely a long drop down!

The West Gallery and the North End of the Rose Window~
You have come to the far edge of the window. It truly is amazing how
expansive all that glass really is! It must have cost a fortune as well, for
the labor involved must have been extreme. It is hard to take your eyes from
the images depicted there, but the gallery beckons still.
The gallery continues north.

The West Gallery~
You are almost at the end of the gallery. The pews continue almost to the wall
and the side windows of the gallery still sparkle with light. In one of the
windows ahead, there seems to be a loose frame. It is hard to believe
that there could be a flaw in this work of art.

You have reached the end of the gallery. There is indeed a loose frame in
the stained glass window above you. Perhaps if you stretch, you could push it
back in place. But be careful! It may come out completely if you tug or
push to hard!

The warm, bright light spills from here to the church below. Both of these
galleries present an excellent view of the church proper from above. Strong
stone buttresses above your head hold the barrel vaulted ceiling aloft and
gilded cherubim and seraphim adorn the impressive stonework.

The East Gallery and South End of the Rose Window~
The eastern rose window begins at this part of the gallery. Filling the
east wall here and to the north, this exquisite giant of the stained glass
artisan seems to burst with light. Pageantic images of faith create an aura
of awe as you look up. You realize that perhaps more than one lifetime was
spent in this window's creation.

The East Gallery and the North End of the Rose Window~
As you continue to gaze at the rose window, you thank the architects of this
place for putting high banisters upon the gallery! The power of the light is
almost enough to physically push at your being. You lean against the sturdy
railing and take a minute to catch your breath. It would have been a long
drop down!

As you near the end of the gallery, you realize the pews don't quite reach
the north wall. There seems to be a gap between the pew ends and the wall that
leads to the north-east corner. Nothing seems to be there, but it might be
worth a peek.

Quarters of the Knight Sergeants-of-Arms of St.George~
This is the quarters of the true taskmasters of the Order. Two sergeants,
each in charge of a squad of twenty Knights, live, plan and sleep in these
quarters. The smell of clove oil is strong here, as the Sergeants make it a
habit of regularly polishing their arms and armor. As strict as they are
with their men, these hard soldiers are twice as hard on themselves. No
normal person would want to cause them grief. They are too dangerous!

their constant creaking has got you a bit nervous. The landing above looks
well supported, and if you can get through the trapdoor, you should be fine.

The Bell Chamber~
This is where the bells of the Cathedral are housed. They are rung for
special holidays, Saturdays at noon and Sunday mornings to announce church
services. The bells themselves are huge and made of bronze. It must take a
good deal of strength to ring them by their bell-cords. There is usually a
hunchback here who acts as caretaker of the bells and the tower.

There are two sinks, a water pump and a long counter with a drying rack here.
There is also a pan holder hanging from the ceiling and a cupboards for cups
and dishes along the walls. This is definitely the dishwashers area. You may
want to consider skee-daddling before the Cook recruits you!

Holy baking can be done here. The bread for the sacrement is baked in these
ovens after a blessing from the priest. The smell of fresh-baked bread
permeates this entire area.

The Kitchens~
This room serves as the prep area for all the meals. Meat is cut, vegetables
are sliced and diced and everything that needs mixing gets mixed here. Bowls
line the shelves and cutlery hangs from pegs on a board above the counter. To
the west is the large room containing the stoves, fireplace and spits used to
cook the mutton, beef or chicken (fish on Friday) and the side dishes that
make up the daily fare. If it seems over-much for a small amount of people,
rest assured that much food is taken to the starving and homeless in the nearby
villages.

Kitchen: Stoves and Fireplace~
This room houses 2 large pot-bellied wood stoves and a fireplace that is 7
feet wide by 5 feet tall. The heat here is somewhat oppressive, but the many
luscious smells coming from the cooking food makes you not want to leave. The
fireplace has a large spit for roasting large meat portions and also small
bread baking holes to either side of the fire. These holes don't get used much
since the addition of the bakery down the hall. Don't think of snitching any
bites, either. The Cook has a wicked rolling pin and a strong arm!

stove stoves~
These two stoves are made of cast iron and look very sturdy. Small stacks of
wood sit by each as fuel. There is also a large ash can and broom-and-shovel
set for both of the stoves. The can is empty, so the scullery maid must have
just emptied it.

Entrance to the Wine Cellar~
There is a small hand operated elevator going down to the cellar. The monks

of wine and potables that they make or have acquired.

This is a single but large room where the cook resides when she isn't, well,
cooking! There is a large poster bed centered against the far wall with a
nightstand by it's side. There is a chest of drawers against the north wall
and a small cedar chest at the foot of the bed. A desk immediately to your
right is surmounted by a bookshelf filled with cookbooks from all over the
world. The desk itself is piled neatly with assorted hand-written recipes of
the cook's own making.

line the walls. In the center of the room is a large table with a sink and
water pump. A stove sits in the corner which is used to heat water for the
canning process.

surface.

The Service Hall~
Continuing down this hallway you will find the Kitchens, the Barracks of the
Knights of the Holy Order of St. George and finally the Abbey. You can smell
food and the tang of clove oil from the Knight's armor and weapons. Oil lamps
light the hallway even though there are windows. Legend has it that for as
long as the lamps are lit, no attack from demonspawn or agent of darkness
can occur.

This is the service part of the kitchen. Food to be served is placed on long
tables where the kitchen lads and scullery maid can move from here to the
various quarters with ease. It is also very visible from all but the bakery,
so the cook can whack any food snitches. Come to think of it, you did see a
few bruises on the knuckles of the priest. Maybe he DIDN'T get them boxing!
