Ruined Home~
You are standing in a ruined home. Walls lie shattered around you, and
the roof has caved in and grown a heavy blanket of sea life. Old furniture,
once used by two legged citizens, lies scattered and rotting across the
floor. A small lawn is to the west, and to the east you can see more
broken ruins.

of the sea. It must not have survived the destruction of the city.

rotting cloth. A small bed, probably that of a child's, is in the corner.

You are in the great arena of Atlantis. Banners hung on poles stream
along in the current just as they would in a light wind. Seats frame the
area in an outline of stone, and a few spectators have come to watch the
daily practices and challenges. The arena continues to the north and west,
and the safety of the streets is to the east.

You are in a small overgrown lawn, neglected by the citizens and attendants
of the city. Small fish scurry about, trying to get out of your way. It seems
there is a ruined house to the west, probably one that did not survive the
cataclysm that was unleashed onto the city so long ago.

The roof has caved in in one spot. Paintings still cling, rotting, to
what were once luxurious walls. Looking around, you even find what must have
been the remains of a small bed, now disinigrated beyond use.

You are in a huge room, somehow kept dry by magic. As soon as your
body leaves the wall of water that blocks the doorway, you are strangely
as dry as if you never set foot beneath water! This room is filled with
tomes and books of all sizes, subjects, and conditions. Magical spellbooks
covered in runes line one shelf, while another is overflowing with
maps of ths city and those beyond. A great tapestry, picturing several
unicorns dancing in a field of gold, is hung on the north wall.

waterproofed scrolls and books, no doubt the Master's own private spells.
A marble plaque on one wall states the names of initiates that have
graduated from the tower with the highest honors.

are pushed against. Even then, only a few of Alexander's proud students
make it to graduation with giving up first. A shimmering field is here to
lessen the impact of practiced spells against the delicate library and
master room.

shiver to think what creatures roam here, unwatched by a king's vigilant
eye.

All around you is the desolate barrenness of the once beautiful city. No
riches greet you here, only rotting wood and stone that still yearns for
the warmth of a sun it will never see again.

You have come across what seems to be a large road slicing through the
ruins. Strangely, the road has been cleared of all obstructions by some
mysterious force or being. The cobblestones can be seen, still retaining
some of their original beauty. The road continues north, and a vastly
overgrown path leads east towards the new city.

You have entered the main room of a large home. More than half the house
is collapsed in a pile of rubble, but this one room made it somehow.
Lanterns still hang on the walls, and someone has replaced the worthless
oil in them with flourescent sea fungi. The small light they offer sheds
weirdly patterned shadows over the room, and a small stone desk stands
underneath the pulsing lights.

The Ruins of the Old City~
The street ends at a huge cliff here, overlooking a huge underwater
valley. Small shapes move about in the gloom, and across from you is another
cliff, in which you can see small houses built into it. Bending over to
see if you can swim down, the air is suddenly ripped from your lungs. You
stagger back, gasping for oxygen to fill your depeleted body. Choking on
water that you haven't felt since you arrived here, you realize that the
magical barrier which allows you to breathe ends at the border of the city.
Visibly shaken, you back away from the edge and head back towards the ruins,
safer in the arms of the dangers you know then in a mystery which could kill
you.

You have emerged from the city and find yourself on the border between
two different worlds. To the west is the beauty and perfectness of Atlantis,
while to the east lies a scene quite different. While still resembling
a city, the ruins have cast away their pretty facade, leaving behind the
dark and mysterious side of the realm.

The cage contains two cats. One is white, with one green eye and one blue
eye. The other is colored much like a tiger.
~
E
cats~
They are adorable, but not nameless.
Both are stars, one new, one old...
One graces the pages of recyclable pages,
The other graces the silver screen.
One is a beach queen,
The other needs a washer to help him clean.
One is flesh, of girlie looks...
The other is stuffed, and lives in books...
~
E
Gidget~
Gidget is a beautiful white cat. Her different colored eyes beg for
a friendly pat from you.
~
E
Hobbes~
Hobbes, the tiger colored cat, is Derilaan's favorite. He sleeps
comfortably in the small cage, waiting for his puuuurfect mistress
to return home and play with him.

Gallery of Souls~
You are in Derilaan's Gallery of Souls. A collage of pictures and paintings
line the walls. Most of them you don't recognize, but a few show the current
gods and goddesses. The frames are all carved into little designs that
portray an aspect of the god.
There is a sign here hanging on the wall.

plaque sign ~
"Never forget what you once were,
Help all, even those who don't deserve it,
Don't help too much--experience is the greatest master,
Never forget to dream and create,
Follow laws,
But make a few of your own,
Forgive even the rudest guest,
Be a good guest yourself,
Enjoy having power, but don't become hungry,
Don't belittle yourself, and take pride in your work,
Love all, and everyone,
Believe in unicorns and dragons,
But most of all,
Be Happy."

Sleeping Quarters~
You are in Derilaan's bedroom. A very comfy bed is in one corner, and
a dresser is stuffed neatly by it, but other than that and the few chairs
strewn about, there isn't much here. A picture frame holds a painting of
Derilaan's loving family: Lunchinon, Lumpi, and Shrike. A couple figurines of
wolves line some of the dressers.

Derilaan's Office!~
You are in a office that looks like its about to collapse under all the
paper piled about. Ideas and creative thoughts spill over the wooden desk.
Poems and stories drown a poor file cabinet in the corner. Drawings of
everything from cats to Poseidon hang on the walls. The only place, it
seems, that is safe from the onslaught of paperwork is, of course, the
wastebasket.

You are standing on a small lawn that has missed the reconstruction
of Atlantis. It is filled with seaweed and other water plants. Beyond the
obstruction of plant life you can make out a broken house. To the west
is the beauty of Crystal Avenue.

Garden of Tears~
The garden is so called because of the medium pool, shaped like a
tear drop, in the center of this beautiful garden. Flowers cover the ground
like a rainbow carpet, and silver maned unicorns munch at purple blossomed
rose bushes. Two great silver dragons dance in the sky, their movements
an answer to your beating heart as you long to be one with the sky.
A small bench is placed near the pool, and looking into the pool, you
see a world much different than this reflected in it. Ripples tear through
the stillness, and there is nothing more but the bright sun mirrored in
the water.

area has not only been freed of the beauty that once held it, but
Poseidon takes no action against the going-ons that occur here. You can

as you notice small fishes playing in the currents. This may have been
lost to the citizens as a home, but it has given a new place for those
who dwell here.

might close upon you as you try to climb around the jagged edges of the
monstrous entrance.

Onyx Tower, Master Room~
A hundred candles line the walls here, each lit with a strange blue flame
that burns even underwater. A large throne of black obsidian and amber
stands against the wall. Aboleths, their slimy tentacles swaying in the
current, rush around in fear, trying to do all they can to appease their
evil master. A huge symbol is painted onto the floor with glowing amber
dye.

Temple Tower, Training Room~
You are in a room completely bare of furniture. All that is here is a
strange silver circle etched into the ground. This is the place where
the clerics come to train.  No challenges, no actual training is needed;
the cleric steps inside the circle and is tested in their faith by their
god.  Passing means the cleric can gain in experience; failure gives death
as a reward.

A throne made of pearl is placed at the far wall. You shrink back
from the brightness of the huge shining holy symbol which is etched into
the oppisite wall, above the throne. It bothers you that looking straight
at the symbol hurts your eyes though it doesn't seem to light up the room
at all.

The Cliffs of Despair~
You are standing on a cliff which gives the perfect view of the plane.
Bright Phoenixes streak across the sky, leaving traces of their holy
fire. A unicorn is here, gazing comtemplatively out into the open sky.
You feel as though your spirit would be free forever, if you could
only jump and catch the wind with wings you do not have. You stare at the
sky, and feel your heart ache in answer to the wingbeats of birds.

lovely Nerieds, sitting on a rock above the sea, watching a huge clipper
ship take passengers to a new land.

a world they will never know. Looking up, you feel the pressure of an
entire sea upon your shoulders. You cannot even see the sun any longer, so
deep is this lost city.

In the pond, a small red bird skips about, pulling at small underwater
creatures for food. It flutters as if swimming in the pond of air.

sounds of children playing inside can be heard.  Bubbles float happily
out the play chimmney, and as the door opens a child mermaid laughs at your
scrutiny.

allowing privacy to those who reside inside. The facets and depth of the
crystal make it hard to get a good glimpse of anything else inside, and
you assume the dark shapes seen through the walls are attendants or guild
members. This is the tower of neutrality, and belongs to the fighters.

carved into the likeness of a jellyfish, is surrounded by many small
seats, all curved to hold slender fins. Each of the chairs has strange
gold runes placed onto them. From your experience here you guess they spell
out the different names of the disiciples that live here. At the head of
the table is a seat larger and stranger than the rest. It is larger than you
would expect would be useful, and has eight small indentures in a circle
around the center.

helpless on the ground of the sinking city, their legs replaced by
shimmering fins. To the east of here you can enter the city, and to the

design carvings symbols story~
The king of the beautiful island of Atlantis had power over the most
beautiful of empires in the world. People came from everwhere to trade in the
marketplace; The Towers of Atlantis trained the best mages, clerics, thieves
and fighters anywhere, and stood as a sign that everyone, no matter what
alignment or occupation, had a welcome spot in Atlantis.
The king, however, drew the conclusion that it was his might and power
that brought the city to this glory. One day, in pride, he ordered the
gods to take him up to them as one of their kind. In return, he
threatned, he would not begin war on the other cities of the world
who, in his opinion, could not compete against his might. The gods,
angered beyond anger at this threat, decided to destroy the city.
Because none of the deities wanted to be known as the destructor of
such a paradise, they drew straws to see to whom the deed fell
It was won by the sea god Poseidon. He did not want to see the
loss of such a great kingdom, so he turned the people into mermen and
sank the entire island, taking it with him underwater. The king was cursed
and turned into the dragon Leviathan, who lies below the rooms of the
palace, chained forever to a mighty pillar. He mourns the loss of his
city and sometimes he can be heard growling deep underground. Currently,
the people of Atlantis go about, still rebuilding the little that is left
after that disaster so long ago. They honor and love their new king, who
in every way tries to do the best for his city.

here a view of Derilaan's plane of E'liFera. Great silver dragons dance
in the sky, and beautiful white unicorns play in the lush green meadows.
Birds of all kinds sing in the trees, and the sight of all this brings
tears to your eyes. Know that you stand in Derilaan's world, for this

There is a huge chessboard here made of stone. The pieces are almost
lifelike, so well did the artist capture their features in stone. A
strange glow enfolds the big statues in a soft light. You assume that they
are magic, and that ordered the pieces will march forward to their appointed
places, or fight an unwanted intruder to their square. One side is black,
with silver highlights on their weapons and armor, and the other is white,
with gold weapons and lines on their armor.

birds, cats, dogs, horses, and just about any non-magical creature you can
