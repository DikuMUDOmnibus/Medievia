You stand at a slot machine, on the Mystara.  The slot is tightly bolted
to the floor, so it doesn't tip over, if the ship were to sway.  There is
excitement in the air, as you think of putting a gold piece in the machine
and testing your luck.  There is an old man in front of you, leaning over
with a old cup of coins.  The room is busy, and needs a good cleaning.

On the mast~
You are climbing up the mast of the Mystara.  You can barely get your legs
around the large wooden pole.  The pole is smooth, but you are careful of
splinters.  You continue to venture up, fore you are afraid to look down.
You seem to be the only one trying to craw up this mast, except for the
sailors, you might want to jump down as soon as you can.

Entrance to the Mystara~
This is the entrance to the great ship, Mystara.  An excitement fills your
soul as you enter this grand vessel. The ship sways and cracks under your
feet.  You look up and see the sails blowing in the wind.  The sails, like
the rest of the ship, are very well kept.  You hear from the party behind
you that this is a fast cutter ship, and will outsail any pirate ship that
might try to take over.  The deck of the ship is large, you look out into
the blue ocean and see the gulls flying by.
