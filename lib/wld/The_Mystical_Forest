A forest glade~
The glade continues here right up to the side of a volcano. From here at its
base you can tell it is no longer active like the other volcano on this island.
You wonder why only one of the two volcanoes would die, since they are so close
together. The steep stone slope of the volcano blocks any further progress to
the north.  A large boulder has fallen down the side of the volcano and now
rests against the slope to the north.

boulder~
The boulder is emmense, much too large to move.  The path is ripped from
volcano's side when it fell is still evident.  On the side of the rock
near the sloped side of the mountain, you see an ancient locking mechanism
built into the stone.

An ocean harbor~
This island had shown no sigh of advanced civilization until now. A
magnificent dock made of stone stands here on the ocean, and the remains of
buildings can be found testifying that this place was used as some sort of
harbor at one time, however that must have been a long time ago. The only
thing left is the stone dock jutting out into the ocean.

The air here has a musty smell to it, as if no one has been here in a LONG
time. It seems to lead slightly up towards the bowl of the volcano at its
center. You hope this volcano doesn't suddenly decide to become active because
if it does, you're toast, literally!

You are at the intersection of South street and Wall street.  You might have
noticed that you're in the poorer section of town. The buildings are starting
to show their age and are crumbling down. The "people" here look poorer
than others your have seen, several of which seem to be crumbling before

On the ocean~
You are on a beautiful blue ocean. Small waves roll past you towards
shore. Looking down you can see the smooth white sandy floor, a few
shells lay scattered about, reflecting the suns light. The waves become
choppy and tretcherous to the west.  A small, forested island is to the
east. It meets the ocean in a steep cliff, preventing your access at this
point.

This street is constructed very differently from the other streets of the city.
Awnings jut out from several of the buildings, and doorways are set back
slightly from the street, effectivly covering the street in shadows. Small
alleyways and nooks in the buildings could allow a person to hide or elude a
persuit. It almost feels as if the shadows are watching you. You had better

Town square~
This is the center of, perhaps, the strangest town you have ever visited.
First there are no 'normal' citizens. They have all been turned into living
statues, apparently so they can live for all eternity. And the city itself
represents the perfect balance these people are striving for. Everything is in
reflected by its opposite. And to top it all off, A huge castle is suspended
directly above you, supported by stone bridges connected to the city wall.

Its been said that Thieves in general don't tend to be a religious bunch. But
every thief knows a god to pray to when he's about to be caught (or been
caught for that matter). This is a shrine to all thoes dark gods that thieves
pray to when in need. Intrigue, Mischief, Deceit, Treachery are all
represented in these shadows, the shadows that hide a thief.

This shop contains everything the begining (or advanced for that matter) mage
might ever need in his adventuring career. Well maybe not quite EVERYTHING,
but most of it. Robes, wands, staffs, daggers everything that a mage could

again mages are kinda strange in general.
A glowing sign hangs on the wall.

'list' to see what i have on hand. 'Buy' <item>

'value' <item> I'll give you a price on something
you want to 'sell' to me!

A small alchemist's shop~
This shop is littered with alchemy equipment. Bottles, beakers, testtubes, and
many other strange items are used in the potion making process. This shop is
dedicated to the production of fine potions, be them clerical or wizardly.
There is a small sign attached to the counter.

Inside the north-west tower~
You are inside a round tower.  Cots and bunk beds are lined up around the
walls and chests sit at the foot of each bed.  The room is fairly clean except
for some dust in the corners.  A circular staircase leads upward through the
ceiling.

The altar room~
This is the room where the clerics take their vows and make their holiest
prayers to the gods they serve. The smooth marble floor has been worn down
from centuries of use by priest kneeling to the gods in the heavens above. The
soft candle light and the chanting of monks in the distance make you feel at
peace with yourself and causes you to forget the troubles of the outside world.

The Cathedral of All Gods~
This cathedral has apparently been dedicated to be representitive of all
faiths, for each seems to be depicted in the architure. The beautiful marble
walls are covered with pictures of different gods, from different eras. The
light comming through the stain glass windows and the light from the candles
makes this an ideal room for medition.

The Hotel Lobby~
You enter a large, spacious room.  The walls are covered in stone
and look very much like a nature surrounding.  Plants and even small
trees grow in various places around the room.  A large fireplace is
built into the west wall and small chairs are placed about the floor.
A mage, dressed in red robes, stands in the corner.

mage~
The mage is a young man, and very handsome.  He wears a long red robe
and is leaning heavily on a wooden staff.  Atop the staff is a carved
dragon's claw clutching a crystal.  He was holding a cup of herbal tea
which he has put down on a nearby table as you approach.
The mage says, 'Greeting adventurers.  I see you possess many fine and
wonderful items.  Would be a shame to spend so much for a innkeeper to
protect your items for you, when I can do it for much less...'
He pauses and makes a motion with his hand, an extradimensional space
appears, a few cubic feet in size.
The man continues, 'I can keep your treasures in here, where they will
be very well protected.'

The Main Desk~
Judging by the number of keys hanging on the wall behind the receptionist this
hotel must be HUGE! On the outside however, it looked no different from the
other buildings. Perhaps they use some sort of extra-dimensional space for
their rooms, because all those rooms could not possibly fit into a building
this small. You wonder if the deteriating magic used to keep the citizens
alive is the same magic they used on the rooms...

A very large tower stands at the corner of the city wall. Apparently the tower
is used to house city guards who walk the walls in a constant vigil over the
town. There must be some way to reach the top of the walls from inside the
tower, but there doesn't seem to be any way to get in to the tower from ground
level.

This street follows the huge city wall around the town. The city vaguely
resembles a square, with the businesses and guilds towards the center and the
residentual areas closer to the outer wall. In fact it looks as if most, if
not all, the houses for the general citizens are located on Wall Street. Looks
like a nice place for a retired adventurer to make a home too.

This street in the south part of town is named because it follows along the
city wall. This is the poorer part of town, small shacks have been proped up
against the wall in several places and the entire street looks like a fire
hazard. City patrols are almost non-existant in this part of town, perhaps due
to the proximity to the thieves guild.

This is a large courtyard in the center of the castle. The castle is really
made up of two towers, one north and one south. The north looks like a royal
citadel, while the southern tower looks more like a tall skinny pyramid, an
obelisk. Through a hazy, half-formed portal above you, you can see a
mystical temple of some sort.

to the east far below with steep cliffed banks.  An arch made of dull
gray stone stands at the edge of the cliff.  Odd runes are carved into the
arch, written in an ancient language.  Beyond the river the trail leads
into a small stand of trees, which blocks your view of the terrain beyond.

of the bright blue sky.  The sun is still hidden by the tall trees,
and only the bright sky lights up the forest.  Rabbits, squirrels,
and other small animals run among the trees, bushes and scrub.  A
few deer show their faces for a moment, then turn and run until their
white tails vanish in the thick forest.  The trail seems to be
opening up just ahead.  You come to a clearing with bright green
grass and some patches of fragrant wild roses.

The Cracked Anvil~
The name of this fine shop obviously refers solely to the anvil and not to the
fine armor that it produces. Having hundreds of years to work on his products
the armorer has obviously reached the top of his profession. Every piece of
armor in this shop rivals that which you have ever seen, gleeming in the
firelight of the forge. A sign glows brightly over the forge.

anvil cracked~
The anvil apparently has been used for centuries. And judging by the strength
of the armorer, he must have gotten a little carried away and hit the thing
just a bit too hard one day. Oh well, these things happen.

sign~
              The Cracked Anvil
Here you will find the finest armor in all the world.
However, I won't sell it to just anyone! So ask
nicely and type 'list' to see what Im willing to sell
to 'ya.

The mouth of a river~
A river is to the north that separates the main island with a much smaller
island. This is the connection between the river and the ocean. A small
waterfall allows the water from the river to join with the ocean and keeps the
ocean from polluting the freshwater of the river.

The source of this river is apparently an underground spring, because the
water bubbles up from below. It is also a hot spring judging by the air
temperature and the steam rising off the water.

hot sand, so unlike the forest.  Your sight is blurred by the heat

in the distance leading you to wonder if they are staying away out of fear or
because they are waiting for an opportune time to strike.

treetops. There are footprints in the dirt which are obviously recent and made
by a human. The valley is curved, like a crescent moon, and the path follows
the north-eastern wall, leading to what appears to be several caves in the
distance.

have taken those mountain climbing classes back in town, eh?

A cave~
You are in a cave that appears to be used as a home. The cave is not entirely
natural, some of the walls have obviously been chipped away with some sort of
tool, and strange pictures have been drawn on the walls in several places.
There is a pit in the floor for building a fire and niches have been carved
in several places for storage. Necessity, not comfort, dictates the layout of
this home.

A turn in the path~
The path gets wider here and has apparently seen much more use. The path
follows the valley as it takes a sharp turn to the south. There are caves
to the north and east. Several buckets are here filled with water leading you
to believe that this is some sort of gathering place for the inhabitants of
this prehistoric village.

natural, some of the walls have obviously been chipped away with some sort of
tool, and strange pictures have been drawn on the walls in several places.
There is a pit in the floor for building a fire and niches have been carved
in several places for storage. Necessity, not comfort, dictates the layout of
this home.

A mountain path~
The small path continues here. You have to hug the wall and travel very
slowly to avoid falling in several places. This is one of those places you
don't want to look down. A fall would mean a long and painful slide down the
side of the cliff, and who knows what waits for you at the bottom. All the
same you'd rather not think about it.

End of the path~
The end of the trail widens as you approach some very important looking caves.
The cave to the east is surrounded by drawings of skulls, dragons, etc. all
drawn in what appears to be blood. While the cave to the south is just the
largest of all the caves you've seen so far, no doubt someone important lives
there.

The cave of the Shaman~
This cave must belong to the shaman of the village. Skulls litter the floor,
strange herbs hang from pouches from the ceiling, and pictures drawn in blood
cover the walls. A large stone altar is in the center of the room, apparently
so the patients have somewhere to die. Pictures of a huge dragon cover one
wall and several sigils of warding have been scribed in blood around them.

pictures picture dragon~
The pictures tell about this mighty dragon. Apparently it fed upon the
people and animals of this forest. The villages finally decided to do
something and lured the dragon onto a smaller island next to this one. Once
the dragon was there, the villagers used some sort of ancient magic to force
the beast into a slumber, forever ridding the forest of its presence.

The chief's cave~
This cave is so large and richly decorated that it must be the chief's home.
Furs from many different animals covering the floor, and a fire pit with a
vent to the outside, keep this cave significantly warmer than other caves you
have visited. Colorful pictures, made of plant dyes, tell the history of the
tribe forever preserving it on the stone walls.  A large boulder blocks
what appears to be more of the cave to the east.

pictures history colorful~
Apparently the tribe did not always live here. The pictures show a huge,
magnificent city, which the villagers leave (or are banished from?) before
coming here. The pictures show the villagers turning their backs on some huge
stone creature, several creatures in fact. The pictures then go on to hail
their chief for defeating the dragon and saving the tribe with his great
leadership.

fur furs~
The furs are off strange animals that you have never seen before. They make
the room much more comfortable to be in. If you didn't know better you'd think
they were being used as a rug.

boulder~
The boulder blocks part of the cave. It has a keyhole and a locking mechanism
which doesn't make sense if these people are as primitive as you thought.
Perhaps there is more than meets the eye in this village.

The village treasure room~
This room is used to hide the treasures of the tribe. Paints made of plant
dyes, grain, crude grain alcohol, and treasure, lie in clay containers on the
floor. Dried meat hangs from the ceiling to make sure the tribe does not go
hungry if a food shortage should occur. Not much here is worth anything to a
civilized person, but you may be able to find something.

The trail becomes rockier as it slowly ascends the slope of a huge volcano.
The path is devoid of all plant life due to previous lava flows. A slight
rumble and a pillar of smoke escape the top of the volcano, warning you
that this is an active volcano.

You are standing at the rim of a huge volcano. The steam that rises from below
is almost hot enough to melt the steel in your weapons, not to mention your
flesh.  Below you, you can see the lava that, you assume, makes this strange
world so hot, furnishing it with lush forests and exotic creatures.

A foul smelling swamp~
A foul smelling gas erupts from the ground in the swamp.  The gas is so
strong you feel as though you might be overcome by the fumes. How anything
could live in this place, you really don't know. By the looks of things
however, some creatures actually prefer this environment.

A foul smelling swamp~
Traveling is not as difficult as you feared and, so far, you haven't run into
any quicksand.  Strange creatures dwell in this swamp, making it scarier than
any you have ever been in before.  The swamp gas is so strong you feel as if
you might be overcome by it. If you did pass out from it some creature would
surely kill you instantly.

The edge of a swamp~
The swamp ends at a small forest glade. The glade to the south looks peaceful
and calm, you can actually hear the call of birds that you recognize. Perhaps
it will be a refuge in this horrible world. First, however, you must get to it
through the muck that makes up this place, no small task indeed.

A forest glade~
What trees there are in this forest are small compared to those you saw on the
other side of the island.  These are more closely related to those found on
the mainland.  There's a mossy clearing here, surrounding by small shrubs
and underbrush.

In a lush forest~
You are in a think, lush forest, surrounded by huge trees.  There is no
path to follow but the underbrush is thin enough to walk through with ease.
The sounds of the jungle's animals fills your ears, it is very relaxing
and peaceful here.  Some branches and vines hang low and the moist, misty
air surrounds you and obscures your vision slightly.

A large clearing in the jungle~
The trees reach far into the sky, as if to try and touch it.  A warm mist
surrounds you as you walk through the dampt forest.  The forest trees surround
you on all sides and the misty air moistens your skin, some long vines hang
down on the path.  You come to a large clearing carpeted with a soft moss,
you can once again see the sky above you.  Looking to the edge of the clearing

A forest path~
Some of the smaller plants have been trampled here making a path through this
thick forest. The lower branches and leaves of several trees look as though
they have been chewed and gnawed on.  Cute forest creatures scurry at the

The clearing allows you to once again see the bright light of day. Its large
enough for even the mightiest dragon to fit in and you're not sure if it's
wise to leave yourself so exposed and visible, you can't help but feel you're
being watched from the shadows.

You are in the middle of a mystical forest on a forgotten island. Strange
creatures hide in the shadows just out of eyesight. Huge beasts lurk just off
in the distance leading you to wonder if they are staying away out of fear or
because they are waiting for an opportune time to strike.

Thick vines and underbrush cover the stones and a blanket of moss coats the
forest floor.  In the center of the stoney clearing sits a deep pool of

A small clearing~
The trail is about ten feet wide.  Overhanging trees block out most
of the bright blue sky.  The sun is still hidden by the tall trees,
and only the bright sky lights up the forest.  Rabbits, squirrels,
and other small animals run among the trees, bushes and scrub.  A
few deer show their faces for a moment, then turn and run until their
white tails vanish in the thick forest.  The trail seems to be
opening up just ahead.  You come to a clearing with bright green
grass and some patches of fragrant wild roses.

home.

On the Moon Bridge~
You are hovering over a river, far below you.  Suspended on an almost
invisible bridge of shimmering energy.  You can see far in all directions.
To the north is a smoldering volcano, surrounded on all sides by a thick,
green forest.  Perched upon it's ledge is a beautiful white, winged horse.
To the east, the bridge slopes down to a small island, completely covered
by a dense, lush wood.  The river runs south to a deep blue ocean which
stretches out as far as you can see.  On the west, the bridge ends at a great,
desert flatland.  Beyond that is the lush forest and a dormant volcano.

You stand on the beach of some long forgotten land. A light mist surrounds you

these days, can be seen in the distance, past a very thick forest. You can
hear the sounds of magnificent terrible beasts echo from the forest
to the south.
