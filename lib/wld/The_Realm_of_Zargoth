A Stone Entry Hall~
The walls, ceiling and floor of this room are bare.  You also notice that it's
warm in these ruins and something is keeping out the cold that you felt before.
The hall seems to continue ahead but it's hard to tell in the darkness that is
so dense down here.

After adjusting to th warmth that you felt before you now no longer notice it.
This room is bare and is simply used as a passage to get from one place to
another.

The end of the Entry Hall~
This room is filled with decaying trophies.  The walls are covered with rusted
and unusable weapons and moldering heads of all manner of beast.  It appears
that somone had spent a lifetime in the pursuit of killing.

A Large Stone Corridor~
This corridor is carved from soild rock.  Who or Whatever made this must have
been very large, or spent their life down here.  Several large colums support
the celing.  This place is unnatural but it seems that there is no life down
here, however the corridor continues ahead but the lack of light makes it
imposible to see what is ahead of you.

you can see some type of faint illumination.  To the east you can't see
anything but a turn in the passage.

A Pleasant Change~
After the freazing cold that was so damaging before, this room is warm and
comfortable to you.  However a glint of silver in to the east catches your eye.
Looking that way you notice a young, but fierce Silver Dragon staring at you.
Obviously the source of the breathing you heard, it just stares at you
intensly watching your every move.

A Broken Down Beadroom~
Tapestries woven with the images of a man dressed in armor fighting beast from
upon a dragon line the walls of this room.  Thick rugs surround the bed that
seems to slop towards the western wall.  You notice that one of the legs is
missing and seems to have broken off.

A Dusty Shrine~
A Column of light rises out of from the shrine.  Around it are various prayer
books written in an ancient language.  The Altar is engraved with ruins and
other protection symbols.  The Altar seems to be new, however due to the odor
in the room, you're sure that it must be rather old.  More Tapestries like the
ones in the room north adorn the walls.

A Small Study~
This room appears to be a study of some kind.  A large comfortable chair stands
behind a oak desk.  The desk seems somewhat decayed.  Slouched over the desk is
a man dressed in armor.

A Winding Passage~
Due to the light radianting from your ligth you can see several large shapes in
the darkness to your north.  Without more light you won't be able to identify
them.  They could be just strange rock formations or whatever it was that drew
you here.

A Lammasu Lair~
This room is bare apart from a reddish-brown paint of some sort all over it.  A smell of death hangs in the air and you see a skeleton laying on the ground.
Judging by the large amounts of blood, this is some type of lair or eatting
area within this cavern.

An Odd Slate Room~
The gray slate flors, walls, and ceiling of this room are immaculate.  The room
has no features and looks as if it was never occupied.  However the room seems
unatural to you, unlike the rest of the Caverns.  A huge trapdoor leads down
from the center of the room.

A Strange Smelling Cavern~
As you enter this room you notice a thick layer of gas that is in the air.
Whatever it is penetrates your nostrils and stops you from seeing the walls of
this section of the cavern.

This area is where a guard stands and watches people who enter the Realm of

The Walls of Zargoth's Past~
The stone walls of this side of the Cavern are decorated with various shields.
Each shield is painted with a silver dragon fighting large demons.  They are
very dented and wouldn't be much use in combat if you could manage to get one
off the wall.

A Large Stone Corridor~
This room is a continuation of the corridor you were in before.  Like the others
it is enormous and unnaturally carved from solid stone.  You see the corridor
continue ahead of you.  There is no light down here apart from that which your
light gives out.

To Be Done~
Following the passage in the darkness it once again changes direction.  As
before the darkness prevents you from seeing what lies beyond in this mass of
stone.

A Strangely Smooth Cavern~
From the outside of this cavern it appeared to be somewhat natural. However
now that you are inside you see strange markings along the walls.  You almost
lose your balance as your foot suddenly drops into some type of claw mark.
Looking at it you notice it has been made by a rather large dragon, maybe you
should leave.
