Before the Entrance to the Swamp~
     The ground underneath your feet has been getting softer and wetter.
A few feet ahead of you there is a large stone archway, and beyond that
you see a marsh.

Entrance to Thanos, Swamp of the Dead~
     Your feet sink a few inches down as you enter into the muck of Thanos.
You must walk carefully since it is not possible to tell where the mud ends
and the water begins.  The swamp appears desolate, but is actually brimming
with life...or is it death?  The ground to the south has sunk several feet
and you find yourself unable to move in that direction.

revelling in the destruction of the river life, thriving on its suffering.
You are compelled to go deeper into the the pit... the odds favor you not.

The Beginning of the Forest~
     The darkness ahead belongs to the forest that stretches before you.
Everything seems normal...the trees are full and green, the animals scurry
about in the search for food.  Enter for adventure...

Further into the Forest~
     Darkness prevades here, permeating throughout.  Bits of light shine
through the dense foliage, aiding minimally to your progress.  Roots, huge
and mangled, entwine your feet slowing you down.

of many an adventurers lay here as a reminder for those who would challenge
the powers that be.  Tread carefully...danger is the least of you problems,
death is the first.

How to Extract Internal Organs without killing the Host, but making sure
to cause him gut wrenching pain.
You stop reading after that...
