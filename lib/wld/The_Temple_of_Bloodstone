Kat's private bath just built by Vryce~
Unlike the rest of Kat's chambers, this area is bathed with the warm glow
of many long white candles.  In the center of the area is a large marble
bath big enough to fit two.  The walls are covered with beautiful vines
and other green foliage thriving from the steam and the gentle sunlight
that fills the room as 3 walls and ceiling are curving glass overlooking
a flourishing flower and tree garden spreading out away from the grounds.
The bath is always filled with hot scented water flowing from a sculpture
of an angel with wings spread wide in glorious detail.  You hear the gentle
sounds of the night and the soft sound of pouring water, candles flutter and
are surrounded by a haze from the steam.  Some brushes, towels and soap rest
on a small table along with some fresh fruit.

Inside the Silver Shrine~
This building consists of only one room with a tall, pointed ceiling.
The walls, ceiling and even the floor are made entirely of gleaming
silver. Ornately carved pillars support the ceiling near the center of

black energy.  Wards and symbols of protection surround the portal.

You find yourself in the center of a charred, destroyed clearing of

on the north and west sides.  Steep, jagged cliffs rise up to the east
and south, blocking your passage.
In the southwest part of the clearing, near the cliffs, is an oval portal
of swirling black energy.

wind blowing through the bare, dead branches of the trees all around you. On
the ground at the far end of the clearing is a decomposing corpse of a human.

A forest path~
You're traveling along a dark and eerie forest trail.  The trees seem to shift
and move around, you're not exactly sure which way you're headed.  Once in a
while you think you see eyes watching you from the darkness, and if you weren't
sure, you'd swear you had been this way before.

antirely of black marble, all polished smooth.  A hallway leads off to the
west.

A long dark hallway~
The impenetrable darkness continues along with the hallway.  They seem to
merge to the point at which you cannot tell where the darkness ends and the
hallway begins.  The only thing which breaks the curtain of silence that
hangs around you is the beating of your own heart, which sounds very loud in
your ears.

the way west.  It is made entirely of black polished stone which seems to

This is a huge room, its walls were once smooth and polished, but now have
scrapes and marks from the many battles faught here.  Piles of bones and armor
have been arranged about the room and all the skulls have been put in a circle
in the center of the room.  A ladder is built into the far wall, leading up.
The gates have closed behind you, sealing off your exit to the east.

riches contained in here, only items fit for a god were kept inside such a

leave while you still can.

There is a weather-beaten sign hammered into the ground at the side of the

In a barren tree~
You stand upon a thick, strong branch of this massive tree. The trunk is
much too large for your arms to encircle.  This limb, which is about twenty
feet above the ground, provides you with an unobstructed view of the
surrounding terrain.  To the east, you see the majestic River Carthein which
stretches endlessly to the north but topples over a deadly waterfall not far
to the south.  On the westen side of the river, a dense forest reaches across
the landscape.  You are surrounded on this side of the river by foothills
and rocky terrain.  Contained within a ring of larger hills to the southeast
is a dark, evil forest.  This limb reaches out to the west, hanging over the
river's surface. Several other branches allow you to climb down the tree, but
there are too few above you to proceed any farther in that direction.

Outside the Silver Shrine~
This is a small clearing in a dense forest.  At the south end is a
small building made entirely of silver.  The roof rises in a sharp
point as high as the tree tops.

A single door provides the only apparent entrance to the building.
It too is made entirely of silver and intricately engraved with
crest of the Knights of Solamnia.

Overgrown path~
You walk along a narrow trail, overgrown with weeds.  Dense trees
border the path on the west and east.  The forest grows thicker and
more sinister to the south.
