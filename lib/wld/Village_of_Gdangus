Entrance to Gdangus Center~
This large center is the main passage in all directions.  A fountain
stands in the center of this room.  A large plaque telling all the
public about the history of Gdangus.  You put on your bifocals
and read:
  "Gdangus, boomtown to local pirates.  Started way back in the days,
a young pirate named Gdangus set up his front here.  Setting up banks,
shops, and other assortments of buisness for the pleasure of plundering.
His creation backfired when it boomed and its wealth grew more than that
of his own crimes.  He quit his pirating job and set forth to be an
entrepeneur of the buisness class.  Making more money than he could
foresee, he set back to his hometown, Village of Gdangus, to recultivate
its areas.  What you see now is its completeness and unchanged stable
community.  We are very law abiding citizens and plan to keep it that
way."

Entrance to the beatiful village, Gdangus~
Hidden beneath the forest trees, this unnoticable village strikes you
with great awe. Multi-colored cobblestone lines your path in all directions.
A large adamantite arch greets your entrance. Small quaint stores are in
perfect condition lining the route in all directions.  A mass of people
travel in and out each day causing the cobblestone to be dull and worn out.
A town crier rests high up on a platform to your north calling out village
information. A noose and hanging stage appears close in distance, symbolizing
that this small village won't put up with any unlawful citizens.
