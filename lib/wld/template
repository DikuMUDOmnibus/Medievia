ROOM NAME- rename me~
OK here is your new zone! Take your time, make me proud. Most of all Have Fun!
The commands are basic.  Makeroom makes rooms. Saveroom will save whole zone,
or use saveroom <zonenumber>. Use ll or listzone to find out the zone
number.  makeroom e  will make a room east, a DIRECT copy of this one.
makeroom e 10  will make 10 rooms east DIRECT copy, like a Fast hallway
editroom is the MAIN command.  Type editroom(ENTER) for a list of options.
makeexit n 1234  will connect this room north to room 1234.  All doors must 
be edited on both sides.  Please be VERY careful when making rooms as they 
are a bitch to delete.  The MOST IMPORTANT time saving thing is to set the
first room up(this one) with all the proper sector type, flags, restrictions,
etc.  Because all rooms will be copied from this one, it will save you a 
lotta time later.  PLEASE make sure all rooms that are inside have a sector 
type of inside and a flag of inside (Vryce hates when it rains indoors).
ALSO DO THIS, restrict this room to level 32.  THE WHOLE zone will be 
restricted to level 32 until it is opened to the public, when I use a command 
to unrestrict the whole zone in one shot.  Any questions, ask any level 35.  
Have a blast, work when in the mood, think it out, make a lotta hidden rooms, 
look ats and custom entrance/exit text when it will add UMPH to the room.
