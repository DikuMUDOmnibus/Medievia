The Cottage by the Ocean~
You stand in a small secluded cottage by the ocean. You can hear the waves
from the Ocean rolling in on to the beach and the seagulls roaming the
sky. This small cottage seems to be a very humble place. There is a
hammock in the corner attached to the bamboo and straw walls of this
little house.  There is a small table with a book resting on it and a fire
stove in the corner. You feel a sense of peace here.

Upstairs Loft Overlooking the Ocean~
You stand in a cozy loft overlooking the ocean. There are doors
in every direction but only two catch you eye. Too the west you see
a beautifal Terrace would could only belong to a Goddess and to your
east you see the study of a busy god.

Patio on the Beach~
You stand on a small patio right outside the cottage. The patio is
built right on the beach. You can see the waves rolling into the beach
and back out on to the water. You can see a beautiful sunset from here.
The sky is a colorful orange and the sun is in between the ocean and the
sky. In the distance you can see a huge boat will it's sails full of
wind riding the ocean waves.

You stand in Raster's study. This room looks nothing like the rest of
this cottage. It is very buisness like and modern. There is a beutifal oak
desk with a computer and phone sitting on it. There is a beutifal persian
carpet on the floor and a huge sky light.
