[ALIGNMENT]
  Alignment ranges from 1000 to -1000
  1000 = Divinely Good, -1000 = Pure Evil
  Can be in the form # or #d#+#

[MOB CLASS]
  Mob class must be one of the following: C, M, W, T, or O
  C = Cleric, M = Mage, W = Warrior, T = Thief, O = Other
  An O class mob will be vertually stupid, using no special skills

[HITROLL]
  Thac0 of a mob is based on its level.  The hitroll field is used
  increase or decrease the given value.
  Can be in the form # or #d#+#

[HIT POINTS]
  Hit Points are in the format of xdy+z
  i.e. 5d10+500

[DAMAGE]
  Damage Dice are in the format of xdy+z
  i.e. 10d5+80 (This mob will KICK BUTT)

[GOLD]
  Amount of gold coins on the mob.
  Can be in the form # or #d#+#

[EXP]
  Amount of experience points the mob is worth.
  Can be in the form # or #d#+#

[POSITION]
  This is the position the mobile enters the game in.

  POSITION_DEAD     = 0
  POSITION_MORTALLYW= 1
  POSITION_INCAP    = 2
  POSITION_STUNNED  = 3
  POSITION_SLEEPING = 4
  POSITION_RESTING  = 5
  POSITION_SITTING  = 6
  POSITION_FIGHTING = 7
  POSITION_STANDING = 8

[DEFAULT POSITION]
  This is the position the mobile is in after it changes from it's
  POSITION.  Use the same numbers as above.
  Note: These two numbers are usually both 8, and the second is
        almost ALWAYS 8.

[SEX]

  !DIS  Cannot be disarmed
  !THR  Cannot be Thrown againt
  !SOL  Cannot be hit by solid objects(swords, punched, kicked, hit etc)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NOTES]

If mobile needs more than one affection_flag or action_flag, add the #'s.
For example, if you want a mobile to be both sancted and have sense life,
the affection_flag # would be 160.

For virtual numbers, talk to Shalafi before you start so he can find you an 
open slot.

Hitpoints and Damage are in form of xdy+z.  This means you roll an x different
y-sided die and add the value of z to determine the hps or damage.  For
example, if a mobiles hps are 5d5+200, then his minimum hps are 205, and max
hps are 225.

AC is Armor Class, and it is in 10's.  Thus, if you want your mobile to have
-100 ac, you write -10, if you want a 70 ac, you write a 7.


[EXAMPLE]

Remember, substitute a tilde for the (tilde).  The only reason I didn't put the
tilde in is because it would be stripped if I mailed a file with a tilde as

[NOTES]

If an object needs more than one extra_flag or wear_flag, add the #'s.
For example, if you want a weapon to hum and glow, the extra_flag #
would be 3.

For virtual numbers, talk to Shalafi before you start so he can find you
an open slot.

Remember to make your item takeable if you want players to wear it.  For
example, if your item is to be worn on the legs, the wear_flag should be
33 (wear_flag for worn on legs is 33, wear_flag for takeable items is 1).

If your item is a light, and you want it holdable as a light, use
wear_flag 16385.

If your item is type_armor, AC applied varies according to body location.
For example, if you use AC apply 10 for a piece of armor worn on the legs,
the actual player's AC will be modified by -20.  On the other hand, if
your item is not of type_armor, and you want it to give AC, then the
modifier 17 should be used (this is actual AC modified, so if you use
the AC modifier for -10 AC, the player's AC will go down 10).

If you want your item to be level restricted, that MUST be the first
modifier.  If you have a level restriction, you can use two other 
modifiers, but if you don't have a level restriction, you can still only
use two modifiers.

          The above values for drunkness/fullness/thirst are used per 
          four "units" drunk. The values are expressed in HOURS!
          Example:
            Dragon empties a bottle (say 7 units) of saltwater.
            His Drunkness is not changed ((7/4)*0)
            His Fullness increases by ((7/4)*1) hours
            His Thirst increases by ((7/4)*-2) hours, thus making
               him More thirsty.

          The hours above are numbers between 0 and 24. 24 hours is
          maximum for drunkness/fullness/thirst. When hours are zero
          for any drunkness/fullness/thirst the person will be
          sober, hungry, or thirsty respectively.

Value[3]: if this value is non-zero, then the drink is poisoned.

        1 = Load only if previous command loaded.

  {loading objects}
    Format: O <if-flag> <object nr> <max existing> <room nr>

  {giving object to mobile previously referenced}
    Format: G <if-flag> <object nr> <max existing>

      [EQUIP POSITION]

        WEAR_FINGER_R = 1

      This command works just like the E commands, except it only equips
      something if it passes the percentile test.

  {loading object_nr1 and placing in object_nr2}
    Format: P <if-flag> <object_nr1> <max existing> <object_nr2>

  {setting state of doors}
    Format: D <if-flag> <room nr> <exit nr> <state>
      [STATE]

  {removing an object from a room}
    Format: R <if-flag> <room_nr> <object_nr>


[NOTES]

Use the if-flag 1 whenever giving an object to a mobile that is loaded the
previous line or equipping an object.  Also, use the if-flag 1 whenever
putting an object within another object.

The max-existing for mobiles and objects should be the same for each line
that loads them, it is the max # of that mob or obj that can be in the game
at a time.  If there are less than that # at a reset, the game will execute
a line loading more.  If there are exactly that max or more, then the game
will not load any more of those mobs/objs.

If you want to load more than one of a certain type of mobile or object,
you must rewrite that line for each one you want the mud to load.

The top of zone is the first room in the zone.  The lifespan is the number
of ticks before the zone is reset.

Please include a comment after each command line telling us what the command
does.  You only need this comment on the first command if you're just using
that command multiple times.

Doors have to be closed on both sides, from each room they are attached on.
If you close only on one side, the other side will remain open.

[EXAMPLE]

Let's say you want to make a door in room #5501 that leads west to be 
closed at every reset, regardless of the command before it, you would write:

D 0 5501 3 1		Set door west from 5501 to closed.


If you want to load the mobile #5501 to room #5503, and have only 3 maximum
existing in the game at one time, and you want it to load regardless of the
previous command, you write:

M 0 5501 3 5503		Green Alligator to room 5503
