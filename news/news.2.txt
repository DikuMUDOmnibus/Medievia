Welcome playtesters!  Please report all bugs to a god.....  You are not
allowed to discuss medievia iv to non testers.  The reason behind this is
medievia iv is not done.  While a lot of the code is done a LOT of balancing
must be done with freight, economy etc...  You are not here to judge
medievia iv in any way as it is not at that stage yet.  With your help we
will get there ASAP.  

Things that need to be done BADLY....
	mobs loading in wilderness
	more survey data entered
	more stables and mounts
	more wilderness room descriptions
	NEW weather
	Mudslinger trading section code (realtime that shows where to sell stuff
										for a lot of money)
	Ability to use someones discarded freight and tradables
	new HIDE module
	Many Many details like objects in wilderness, special procedures...

Remember your not here to level...all you do here will be wiped.  Please
help us test the playability of the mud...so we can balance things.  Expect
many many crashes.  It will take a while to get bug free.
