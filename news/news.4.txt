REMEMBER:  You can at any time read old news... Just type news #

I wanted to talk about TRADING a bit.  You will notice that you will get a
LOT for trading goods initially.  The reason is that it will take REAL
PLAYER trading to balance the economy.  For instance.  Septain was getting a
mil for trading a barrel of ale from med to tar valan right down the road. 
The reason is that the code initially seeded all local economies equally. 
As time goes by MANY people will make that easy trade run and tar valan will
have a lot of ale.  As they get more and their ale storehouse fills up they
will pay less and less.  SO as you can see trading will become a TRUE
economy but it WILL take a lot of time.  I encourage everyone to trade trade
trade.  Soon the mudslinger will have a trading section that gives a
realtime stock sorta listing of supply and demand.  It will show who needs
what the most, thus paying more.  When you SELL a tradable some random place
in the world USES a random tradable.  Understand?  So if for some reason
getting goods a to goods b is Hard it will over time make it so economy b
will pay a lot for goods from economy a cause they are simply running out. 
The economy code in medievia is very deep and complex but its outcome is a
very REAL and very EASY to understand trading system.  I am sure the trading
equations will need to be tweaked...but we just wont know until a lot of
trading has taken place.
