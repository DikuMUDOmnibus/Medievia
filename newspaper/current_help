How Do I Read the MudSlinger?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MudSlinger is set up like a real newspaper.  Each story has it's own 
'look at <STORY>' keyword.  For example, if we had a story about the 
catacombs, the most likely "keyword" would be CATACOMBS.  Therefore, to 
read the story would would type 'look at catacombs' or 'look catacombs'.  

You can find the keyword of a story 3 ways:

1) Look at the newspaper (front page).  Each story has this setup:

[HEADLINE OF STORY IN CAPS]
By [AUTHOR]  (See [KEYWORD])

Some storys are too long and require 2 parts.  They will be in the format 
STORY,STORY2 where STORY2 is the continuation of the story.

2) Look at the index.  Type 'look index' and you'll see a listing of each 
"section" with it's keywords followed in CAPS.  The index is a great tool 
after you read the front page to remind yourself of other stories.

3) *New in this issue* Look at the article.  At the top of each article 
is the keyword next to the author's name, just like the front page.

If you need further help with the paper or have any other suggestions, 
please talk to either Columnus or Yugo when they are online.
