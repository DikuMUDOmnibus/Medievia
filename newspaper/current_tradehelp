HELP ON THE NEW MUDSLINGER TRADING SECTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MUDSLINGER now has a trading section.  It lists 100 MAJOR needs across 
the world.  It is sorted from top down.  The sort is from 0 to 100 of 
items INSTOCK.  Only 12 needs from each local market are shown.  So it 
shows 100 major needs but not more then 12 from any one market sorted 
highest top to least bottom though all 100 would be very major needs.  It 
gives where the need is, what it is, how much of that item they have, how 
much it costs to buy it and what you can sell it for there.  I want to 
remind all that this whole economy IS player driven.  It is an amazing 
thing.  You will see that the major needs almost always represent 
something that is produced VERY far away from where the need is. Some 
shops like the arctic one can only be gotten to by horse and is very
very far away.  You can, as you see, make 1-100 million sometimes with a
wagon full of stuff.  The adventures you will happen upon during your
travels will be worthy of re-telling.
